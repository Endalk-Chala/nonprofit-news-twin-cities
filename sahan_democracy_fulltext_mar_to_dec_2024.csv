"After building lives in Minnesota, many Venezuelans fear rollback of TPS",https://sahanjournal.com/immigration/venezuelans-minnesota-temporary-protected-status/,2024-12-16,"Elza Goffaux, Cynthia Tu, More Elza Goffaux, More Cynthia Tu, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VenezuelaACS_007.jpg,"As protests broke out following the disputed Venezuelan election this summer, Miguel David Pacheco Gómez tracked the rallies and government crackdown on social media. From his adopted home in Hopkins, he looked for ways to show his support for opposition leader María Corina Machado.

The former student organizer first fled Venezuela in 2016, a year when hundreds of thousands took to the streets to protest the economic policies and demand the recall election of President Nicolás Maduro.

“I feel sad not to be able to be there right now, also to do my part, to go out and protest,” Pacheco Gómez said from the sidelines of a softball game in September. “But I think it would also be in vain, maybe I would be imprisoned, I would be dead or they would be torturing me.”

Pacheco Gómez arrived in the U.S. in 2021, and made his way to Minnesota, where he joined a tight-knit community of Venezuelan immigrants and asylum seekers that has nearly doubled in the last three years.

One in four Venezuelans has fled the country in recent years due to the country’s political and economic turmoil. While most landed in neighboring countries, more than 500,000 are currently in the U.S., where many are eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or another program, humanitarian parole.

But the election of Donald Trump has made the future uncertain for many Venezuelans, as he has threatened to scale back programs that shield more than 1 million immigrants and carry out the largest mass deportations in U.S. history.

Ana Pottratz Acosta, an immigration attorney who teaches at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law, advises those who do not have U.S. citizenship to talk to a lawyer and get in the safest position possible.

“I think we need to wait and see what happens with the incoming Trump administration in terms of what their decision is to re-designate Venezuela for TPS,” Pottratz Acosta said, noting that the secretary of Homeland Security has to prove that the situation in Venezuela has improved to end the designation.

“The problem right now in Venezuela is that the situation since October of 2023, when TPS was redesignated, has gotten much, much worse,” Pottratz Acosta said.

A growing community

Four years ago, when the local Venezuelan Softball League started, only four teams were playing. Now, twelve teams compete from April to October every year, each representing a geographical area of the country.

Pacheco Gómez joined the league two years ago at the invitation of a friend. He manages a team called Los Niños de la Tapestry, in honor of his church.

The church is one hub of the local Venezuelan community; the softball league another. Fernando Rivas, co-founder of the league, said it’s a way to build connections and also help incubate new businesses. Food vendors set up at games and also sponsor teams.

“They are entrepreneurs who are just starting, they don’t have a restaurant or anything,” said Rivas, who emigrated from Venezuela to Minnesota in 2018. “From there they get a food truck and then get a restaurant.”

Dressed in red aprons and caps, Johanna Bravo and Zonia Celis had set up their stand at a game in September. The couple sells shawarma and papa loca, a Venezuelan potato dish topped with chopped pork, beef, chicken, bacon and cheese.

Celis arrived first in Minnesota, in April 2022. Later on, Bravo joined her. The pair met in Ecuador, Bravo’s home country, where Celis traveled after leaving Venezuela. The two women decided to move to the United States to flee homophobia in their respective countries. In Ecuador, Johanna Bravo received death threats because of her sexual orientation and was beaten and shot at. When she fled, she had to leave her daughter behind.

As a Venezuelan, Celis was eligible for TPS. On weekdays, she works at a decoration store and, on weekends, she sells food. Back in Venezuela, she was already running a food business — and playing softball. Bravo, who has been in the U.S. for a year and a half, does not have a work permit and is not eligible for TPS. Both of them applied for asylum and the couple hopes to get a food truck in the future.

“I like Venezuelan people, they are very cheerful, just like in my country,” Bravo said at the softball game, a little before some music started playing on the field. “I identify with this atmosphere, because we are like that — the coastal people of Ecuador.”

A backlog of asylum cases

Ten years ago, Melissa Melnick Gonzalez founded the Tapestry Church, a Lutheran church that offers services in Spanish and English. A few members of the community were from Venezuela, most of them musicians, she remembers. But it is mainly since early 2023 that the Venezuelan community at the church has grown.

“Most Venezuelans don’t come as refugees,” Melnick Gonzalez said. “And even if they have TPS, they don’t qualify for much assistance, so we end up piecing together things that we can do.”

Some apply for asylum when they arrive in the U.S. The asylum backlog in the Bloomington Immigration Court has grown from seven cases in 2018 to 931 cases this year.

Melnick Gonzalez provides help in finding clothing, jobs, and assists with legal matters. “People who’ve been arriving more recently have far fewer resources than people who arrived in the early ’90s,” Melnick Gonzalez said.

With five other congregations, Tapestry also agreed to sponsor Venezuelans through humanitarian parole, a program launched by the Biden administration to provide legal pathways to immigration. The church has filled out more than 30 applications since March 2023, but is still waiting to hear back on those cases.

A year and a half ago, the church helped Pacheco Gómez apply for family reunification through humanitarian parole for his daughter, who stayed in Venezuela. So far, he has not heard back.

“It has been the hardest thing in my life to be separated from her,” said Pacheco Gómez. “My role as a father, I have not been able to enjoy that experience because, unfortunately and sadly for me, I had to emigrate.”

Between October 2022 and the end of August, close to 117,000 Venezuelans came to the U.S. under the program, according to Customs and Border Patrol data. However, Biden announced in October that people enrolled in the humanitarian parole process will not be able to renew their status when they have completed the two years of the program.

As many as 350,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. are currently protected from deportation under TPS and have the right to work. But that designation will expire next year, in April for those who applied for TPS for the first time last year and in September for those who have been TPS holders since 2021.

To Melnick Gonzalez, there is a lot of uncertainty. She also expects rules related to immigration to change drastically.

“Some people have lived afraid from deportation for a long time,” she said. “So [there is] a general sense of ‘We don’t know what the future holds.’”

Trump is also expected to target refugee resettlement programs. In Minnesota, 91 Venezuelan refugees arrived in fiscal year 2024, according to U.S. State Department data. In fiscal year 2023, only 19 Venezuelan refugees resettled in Minnesota.

‘The circumstances forced us’

Every Sunday, Tapestry congregants share a meal in the basement of the church. In mid-September, the congregation prepared a Mexican feast to celebrate its 10-year anniversary. Gladys Garcia, called Mileidy by her friends, sat at a table with Fernando Rivas and Ada, his sister.

The Rivas siblings are the first Venezuelans, outside of her family, that Garcia met, two years after moving to Minnesota. They quickly realized that they were not only from the same state, Zulia, but also the same village, Caja Seca.

Garcia moved to Minnesota in 2019 with her son. Her daughter was already living in the U.S., where she played tennis. In Venezuela, she was ranked in the top three of the country. Garcia, who was on the Venezuelan volleyball team, had a tourist visa to the U.S.

“I had no intention to emigrate,” said Garcia. “But the circumstances forced us.”

In Venezuela, Garcia and her family faced harassment. She opposed the government and signed the “Tascon list” demanding the recall of president Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s predecessor. When her daughter moved to the U.S., Garcia was harassed at work. Working as a lawyer in a national petroleum company, she was seen as a traitor due to her U.S. ties.

With the economic crisis, Garcia had to start selling items from her house. Her salary went down to the equivalent of $10 a month.

Garcia and her family now live under TPS and have applied for asylum. She passed a paralegal certification and helps other immigrants with their paperwork, while working as a Spanish teacher at a St. Paul language center.

Her brother joined her on humanitarian parole, and Garcia also applied on behalf of her mother. She is worried about the upcoming Trump presidency.

“He was very harsh on immigrants during his campaign, I felt like he was going to deport me, I took it personally,” Garcia said.

But as the election ended, Garcia thought that she should wait and see what Trump’s government will look like. She also thought that asylum is a law, a human right, and that the president-elect will not likely be able to change it.

Holding onto the culture

At the Lapiz Magico, children of Latin American immigrants can stay connected to the Spanish language. Ada Rivas runs a child care center in her Bloomington home where she teaches young children and toddlers through play in Spanish.

In Venezuela, she dreamed of opening this type of child care. But she was only able to do it long after she immigrated to Minnesota.

“Here, in my house, I get to be the teacher from Venezuela,” Rivas said.

Back home, she was forced to wear red, Chavez’s trademark color, and teach the slogan “motherland, socialism or death” to young kids. She also was required to hang images of armed soldiers or tanks on the walls.

On a morning in mid-September, children played with figurines on the floor under Rivas’ watchful eye. One of them, Kamila, a 4-year-old from Venezuela who recently arrived in Minnesota, was wearing a gauzy purple dress.

Rivas turned to them and asked: “Where is the soldier?” The kids looked into the bin and found a green figure. “It looks like a soldier but it does not have a weapon,” Rivas noted.

Rivas left Venezuela after the government threatened to close her family’s business when she wouldn’t toe the party line. She has lived in Minnesota for seven years, but was denied asylum.

Two years ago, she married her husband, whom she met at the church. But, while applying for a residency, the ICE questioned whether the marriage was real and denied it.

A perilous journey north

At the Tapestry church, Rivas also met Isaura Morillo, Kamila’s mother. Without a work authorization, Morillo started volunteering at the Lapiz Magico and enrolled her 4-year-old daughter.

Morillo and her family entered the U.S. through the Texas border in December 2023. They are not eligible for TPS; the deadline for application was in July 2023 for Venezuelans. The court date for her asylum case is not until 2027.

In the meantime her husband has occasional work in a mechanic’s shop. The couple has found an apartment with the help of a friend, after sleeping in shelters and churches.

“It was very complicated because every morning we had to go from one place to another,” said Morillo.

Originally from Guárico in the countryside, Morillo left Venezuela in 2020. In order to support her parents, who were often extorted by a local gang, she decided to move to the United States. It was a difficult choice for her to make. On the way to the U.S. she crossed Central America and Mexico with her husband and her daughter.

“Mexico was horrible, going through Mexico was worse than the jungle,” said Morillo, who remembers sleeping in the streets and fearing theft.

From her new home in Minnesota, she misses the food and the culture of her homeland, but more importantly her family.

“My mom told me that my grandmother was crying because she says she doesn’t know if she will see me again and that kind of thing is what hurts me the most,” Morillo said. “I hope to come back someday.”

‘Never thought the regime would end in our lifetime’: Syrians in Minnesota celebrate Assad’s fall,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/minnesota-syrians-relief-assad-regime-falls/,2024-12-10,"Elza Goffaux, Katelyn Vue, More Elza Goffaux, More Katelyn Vue, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/syria1_resized.jpg,"Growing up in Syria, Nour Khayou remembers giving fake names when her teachers were asking for her parents’ identity. From a very young age, she learned she should give no information on her family’s identity or politics to anyone, fearing Bashar al-Assad’s secret police.

When protests broke out in her hometown, Al Suwayda, last year, Khayou stayed away from the crowds, worried she would be arrested if she tried to leave and reenter the country.

“I’m so happy that people today are celebrating in the streets and are no longer scared of being imprisoned or detained,” said Khayou, 19, now a freshman in psychology and neuroscience at Macalester college. “They can freely express what they’re feeling and celebrate this victory.”

Early on Sunday, rebel groups in Syria took the capital Damascus and announced that Assad’s regime had fallen, after 53 years of brutal dictatorship. The Syrian community in Minnesota is celebrating from afar, but their happiness is weighted with fear of the atrocities that are yet to be discovered.

“I never imagined that 14 years of war would end in less than a week,” said Khayou. “[I thought] I would have grandkids by the time Assad would leave; he was preparing his son to take over after him.”

Since the rebel offensive started on November 27, Khayou was worried for her family and friends back in Syria as the regime was bombarding cities taken by the rebels. Power outages made it harder for her to keep contact with her family. And it was almost impossible for Khayou to keep up with work at school in the meantime.

Assad’s administration was overthrown in 10 days. The Assad family fled to Russia and was granted asylum according to Russian state news.

Nora Nashawaty spent most of Thanksgiving weekend with her family, watching the news coming from Syria on TV and her social media feed. Her hopes rose as she saw rebel groups take city after city. It reminded her of the beginning of the revolution in 2011 and gave her goosebumps.

“We never thought the regime would end in our lifetime,” Nashawaty, 32, said, whose father left Syria in the 1980s.

Nashawaty was born and raised in the U.S. and now lives in Chanhassen. The last time she was able to travel to Syria was in 2009. She was later put on a black list and could not enter the country, because of her activism supporting the Syrian revolution from the U.S.

Since the fall of the Assad regime, Nashawaty is often on the phone with her family in Syria and around the world. For the first time, she saw her cousins curse Assad on group chats, and she had an unfiltered conversation with her grandmother.

“I never imagined she would ever say anything political, I never imagined her expressing joy about [what’s] unfolding,” said Nashawaty. “We have a saying in Syria that the walls have ears, and it’s just about how much the security apparatus of the state was infiltrated into every aspect of people’s lives.”

At least 100,000 Syrians have disappeared under the Assad regime in the last decade and thousands have been imprisoned. Rebel groups broke through prisons to free tens of thousands of political prisoners from major cities like Damascus, Aleppo, Hama and Homs. Videos circulated on social media showing rebels opening prison doors, detainees walking free in the streets, and families being reunited.

St. Paul resident Yaroub Almahamid feels an intense mix of joy and also grief when he sees updates from Sednaya prison, where thousands were imprisoned and killed.

“If we think about it, remember it, anybody in Syria becomes crazy,” said Almahamid, 38. “Every family has somebody who is an immigrant, who is dead in the sea, who is in prison, or dead from the bombs.”

While groups tried to access the underground levels of Sednaya, where many detainees are believed to be held with very little oxygen, rebels found torture instruments and rooms used as mass grave.

“We Syrians know how bad it’s been but now we’re seeing the evidence,” said Nashawaty. “Video after video, after video, realizing how much torture and how much oppression our people have been facing.”

After watching videos coming out of the prisons during the weekend, Khayou woke up in the middle of the night on Monday having a nightmare, unable to breathe.

“I don’t think any Syrian can heal or be normal after what we’ve witnessed,” she said. She noted that most doctors, therapists and psychiatrists left Syria and the health care system is in crisis. She hopes to complete a graduate degree in clinical psychology and return to Syria as a doctor.

More than 6 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011. In Minnesota, 1,516 people are of Syrian descent and 108 refugees were resettled this year, twice as many as in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of State.

Almahamid left Syria in 2013 after being injured in a bombardement and arrived in Minnesota in 2021. He hopes to visit Syria soon, and show the country to his children, who were born in Jordan. But he is not planning to move back soon.

“I am still hesitant — last night Israel bombed Syria again,” Almahamid said on Monday. “That would be terrible for my children. I don’t need them to scream like the people in Syria; a lot of people are crazy from the bombs.”

Almahamid also noted that many people in Syria do not have work and are struggling to feed their families. Over 90% of the Syrian population lives under the poverty line.

Nashawaty also hopes to visit Syria soon for the first time in years.

“On the horizon I might be able to go back, I might be able to go see my family, I might be able to walk the streets I used to as a kid,” she said. “I just can’t comprehend it.”

This week has also been the occasion for the community to come together. There has not been a protest for Syria in a while in Minnesota. But on Sunday, when she attended the Human Rights Day rally organized by the Anti-War Committee in Minneapolis, Nashawaty saw Syrian refugees joining the crowd.

“And they’re just spreading their hope and their joy to the Palestinians,” said Nashawaty. “We didn’t think anything would get better, and look where we are. And we want this for you.”"
Minneapolis City Council calls for charges against pro-Palestinian student protesters to be dropped,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/university-minnesota-gaza-protest-minneapolis-council-resolution/,2024-12-03,"Elza Goffaux, More Elza Goffaux, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CityCouncilProtestors_005.jpg,"Minneapolis City Council members backed a resolution on Tuesday demanding all criminal charges and academic discipline be dropped against the student protesters who occupied Morrill Hall in October. About 50 activists packed the room to show support for the resolution.

Members of the Committee of the Whole voted 7 to 5 in favor of the resolution, which also called for the university to work with activists to achieve their goals of divestment from Israel and an academic boycott of Israeli institutions.

In January, the council passed a measure calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. military funding for Israel.

“I firmly believe that these actions will place the university, the county and the city on the right side of history,” said Council Member Robin Wonsley, who introduced the resolution. She represents Minneapolis’ Second Ward, which includes neighborhoods surrounding the University of Minnesota.

Ahead of Tuesday’s vote, University of Minnesota officials submitted a letter to council members emphasizing the damage caused by the Oct. 21 takeover of Morrill Hall and the stress of staff members trapped in the building that day.

Eleven people were arrested after the takeover of the building by members of the campus chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The action came after university regents voted down a request to divest from companies involved in Israel’s war in Gaza.

Of those arrested, eight are current students and three are recent graduates. Criminal charges were dropped against all but one, a recent grad who faces fourth-degree assault.

Last week, the University suspended seven of the eight students. Suspensions ranked from one to five semesters, during which students won’t have access to their transcripts. Students are also required to pay more than $5,600 each to cover damages which the university says will cost more than $67,000 to repair.

“We have seen many peaceful protests this fall. However, what happened in Morrill Hall yesterday was not a form of legitimate protest,” President Rebecca Cunningham said in an Oct. 22 letter to students, faculty and staff.

She added: “These actions crossed the line into illegal activity when they actively threatened the emotional and physical safety of our employees, prevented their free movement, disrupted building operations and destroyed campus property.”

To be readmitted, students will have to complete 20 hours of community service and write an essay about the difference between vandalism and protest. Students plan to appeal the decision.

“None of the charges were justified by citing evidence of individual actions at all,” said Annie Russell-Pribnow, an alum and SDS member who was arrested during the occupation of Morrill Hall.

A second City Council vote will take place on Thursday, and if adopted, the resolution will go to the mayor’s office. Student protestors and faculty expect Mayor Jacob Frey to veto the resolution. Nine city council members will need to support the resolution to override his veto.

For University of Minnesota student and SDS member Juliet Murphy, this first vote on the resolution is a huge win.

“This is a very important resolution because I think it will determine what we see in the future in terms of the protest repression,” said Murphy, who fears that suspensions will become the norm.

“It also must be stated, as we are going to a Trump presidency, we are likely going to see increased criminalisation and repression of protests,” said Wonsley. “It has [been] disappointing to see the University of Minnesota appear to comply with this alarming approach by also passing stronger anti-protest policies and arresting students.”

When presenting the resolution, Wonsley also stressed the legacy of campus activism and nonviolent protests that were first criminalized and are now celebrated for achieving social change.

“Decades from now the University of Minnesota community will look back and honor students who protested for Palestinian human rights in 2024,” she said. “But we don’t have to wait 30 years to acknowledge those who are protesting against genocide.”"
St. Cloud appoints first Somali American to City Council,https://sahanjournal.com/news-partners/st-cloud-first-somali-american-city-council/,2024-12-03,"Jenny Berg, The Minnesota Star Tribune, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Resize-Photos-1.png,"ST. CLOUD – She’s an author, a small-business owner and a nonprofit director. And after a successful interview on Monday, Hudda Ibrahim holds another prominent role as the first Somali American member of the St. Cloud City Council.

The City Council appointed Ibrahim to the seven-member board after interviewing nine candidates for the Ward 3 seat left vacant by Mayor-elect Jake Anderson, who will take office in mid-January.

Dave Kleis, who is retiring after two decades as mayor, administered the oath of office to Ibrahim on Monday night following a standing ovation. The City Council planned to vote by ballot until one candidate had at least four votes, but the process was short: Every City Council member selected Ibrahim on their first vote.

“To be able to unite this entire whole council on the first ballot, I think, is very significant and really shows a lot about your candidacy,” Kleis said.

Ibrahim, 39, has lived in St. Cloud for almost two decades. She has multiple degrees, including a master’s degree in conflict resolution from the University of Notre Dame and a doctorate in higher education and leadership from St. Mary’s University.

She runs a consulting company with her husband, Abdi Mahad, that provides diversity and inclusion training to area businesses and organizations. She also recently started a nonprofit, OneCommunity Alliance, aimed at helping residents achieve homeownership. And she’s written several books, including one detailing how central Minnesota became home to many Somali refugees, as well as children’s books that feature underrepresented characters such as kids wearing hijabs.

The St. Cloud City Council has long been older, whiter and more male than the city’s demographics, even as the city has grown increasingly diverse. Since 2010, the share of residents of color in St. Cloud has grown from about 10% to 30%. Beginning in 2017, Ibrahim and Mahad started hosting “Dine & Dialogue” events featuring sambusas, Somali tea and conversation as a way to counter misunderstandings about refugees and immigrants.

Ibrahim ran for the council earlier this year; she finished second of 16 candidates in the August primary but fell short in November, earning 13% of the vote to finish fifth of six candidates.

“Representation does matter, and I believe the 30.3% of the people in St. Cloud who are people of color should be represented in local government, and we’re not,” she said in the fall. “I would like to be the first Black, Muslim woman elected to the council, but I want people to elect me because of my competence, commitment, leadership and educational background, not my ethnic background.”

While Ibrahim hasn’t held public office before, she’s served on several boards, including the St. Cloud Area Chamber of Commerce, the mayor’s downtown St. Cloud task force, the Central Minnesota Community Foundation and Anna Marie’s Alliance.

Ibrahim’s first full meeting will be Dec. 16. The City Council members elected in November — Tami Calhoun, Mark Johnson and Scott Brodeen — will be sworn in Jan. 13, joining Dave Masters (Ward 1), Karen Larson (Ward 2) and Mike Conway (Ward 4).

During her interview, Ibrahim said she’s spent her career working to empower individuals and she’s excited to continue collaborating to make the city a better place for all: “I love our city and when you love something, you step up, you fight for it and you do whatever you can to make it better.”"
Senator Omar Fateh announces run for Minneapolis mayor,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/omar-fateh-minneapolis-mayor-election-jacob-frey/,2024-12-02,"Joey Peters, More Joey Peters, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/4.png,"State Senator Omar Fateh declared his candidacy Monday morning for Minneapolis mayor in next year’s city election.

Flanked by 14 supporters at the rotunda in Minneapolis City Hall, Omar described himself as a “husband, renter, son of Somali immigrants and a longtime advocate for working people.”

Omar, a Democrat, said it’s getting harder “to build our lives” in Minneapolis, and accused Mayor Jacob Frey and “the status quo” of failing the city’s residents.

“Minneapolis residents are working hard for the city that they love, and they deserve a mayor that works as hard as they do,” Omar said.

Frey, who is nearing the end of his second term as mayor, told the Star Tribune last month that he plans to run for reelection.

In a prepared statement, Frey campaign spokesperson Sam Schulenberg said Frey welcomes Omar to the race and looks forward to “presenting voters with a clear choice between two contrasting visions for the future of Minneapolis.”

“Mayor Frey’s responsible leadership has helped the city recover while making critical progress toward rebuilding the police department, leading the nation in affordable housing, and supporting workers and local businesses,” the statement said.

Schulenberg criticized Omar for supporting the failed 2021 effort to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new public safety department, and warned that Omar would “rubber-stamp the most extreme voices on the City Council.”

Rev. DeWayne Davis, a pastor at Plymouth Congregational Church in south Minneapolis, is also running for mayor in the November 4, 2025 election. Minneapolis City Council Member Emily Koski has also said she is considering a run for the office.

Omar spoke in general and broad terms Monday about what he’d do as mayor, and focused on his legislative accomplishments at the Capitol while representing parts of south Minneapolis for the past four years.

They include authoring or co-authoring successful bills that grant free college tuition to students from families making yearly household incomes of $80,000 or less, and securing $19 million in public safety spending for Minneapolis.

All of these came during the Democratic-Farmer Labor Party’s control of the state Senate, House of Representatives and governor’s office during the past two years. Omar emphasized that Democrats control Minneapolis city government, but are not seeing similar results.

“Serving in the Minnesota Senate, I’ve seen firsthand what a progressive Legislature can do with the right executive,” he said. “As mayor, I’ll work with the progressive city council to achieve real wins for our neighbors and uplift those who are struggling to get by.”

Community supporters who introduced Omar Monday criticized Frey’s administration for vetoing a city ordinance increasing wages for Uber and Lyft drivers, and for not doing enough to change city policing in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020.

Asked how he’d act differently than Frey on the consent decree between Minneapolis and the state Human Rights Department to reform policing, and a similar agreement with the federal Department of Justice, Omar said he’d spend time listening to the community on policing issues.

Similarly, when asked about how he’d address the current shortage of police officers in the city, Omar said the police department needs to change its strategy “from the top.”

Omar said he saw successful responses to victims who were in crisis during a ride along with police, and heard similar stories in conversation with officers.

“But in a lot of those responses, we’ve had way too many officers showing up when someone, for example, was in a mental health crisis,” he said. “To me, when we talk about staffing shortages, we’ve also got to talk about what is the strategy? How do we place people in times of need in the right place? When people call 911, they deserve the right approach at the right time.”

Omar was first elected to the state Senate in 2020, after beating longtime incumbent Jeff Hayden for the DFL nomination in the primary. He was reelected to a four-year term in 2022.

His legislative tenure hasn’t been without controversy. In 2022, a Senate committee ordered him to undergo campaign finance training after failing to disclose payments he made for online campaign advertising.

That same year, Omar’s brother-in-law was convicted of lying to a grand jury about how he handled absentee ballots while he was volunteering for Omar’s first campaign. Omar told a Senate ethics panel that he did not know how the ballots were handled; the panel dismissed an ethics complaint against Omar on the matter."

Minnesota’s Driver’s License For All law went into effect last October, making Minnesota the 21st state or U.S. territory to allow undocumented people to legally operate a vehicle. Many immigrants at a recent class about how to apply for a license said they’re taking a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration.

They’re aware of his anti-immigrant rhetoric and plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, but say it’s still speculation at this point. Without permanent legal status, they say, they’re always at risk in the United States, no matter who is in the White House. The licenses are also available to people who are in the country legally but don’t have permanent residency, such as immigrants who have been granted Temporary Protected Status.

“We think that if we are on a good path, it won’t affect us,” Mayreli, a Venezuelan immigrant, said of Trump’s plans.

Mayreli, who is being identified by her first name only because of her immigration status, said most immigrants from her country are professionals who just want to work, and that obtaining a driver’s license and identification card are important steps. Trump’s campaign promises are scary, she said, but she believes he’ll mostly target criminals.

She took the driver’s license exam a week after the election.

The state does not share information about licensed drivers with federal immigration authorities absent a court order, the Minnesota Drivers and Vehicle Services (DVS) office said in a statement to Sahan Journal.

“We only share data as allowed or required by law,” the statement said. “We will only share information if required by a state or federal judge order after exhausting all legal means.”

The first year of Driver’s License for All saw a 500% spike in driver’s license tests taken in Spanish. The test is offered in nine languages, including Dari, French, Hmong, Karen, Pashto, Russian, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.

Minnesota issued 25,223 driver’s licenses to people using foreign birth certificates or passports as documentation this year as of November 13, according to DVS. The department noted that using a foreign document to obtain a license does not necessarily correlate with an applicant’s immigration status, and that details of who used such documentation is not public information or available to law enforcement.

Licenses issued through the law are indistinguishable from other licenses, though non-permanent residents are not eligible for the federally-accepted Real ID, DVS said.

Having a driver’s license prevents undocumented people from ending up in the court system for small traffic violations, which can trigger deportation processes, experts say.

Pursuing a better life

Comunidades Organizando el Poder y la Accion Latina (COPAL) hosts driver’s license classes and written exams in south Minneapolis. Exactly a week after the election, a group of 15 attended the early afternoon exam. The group, including Mayreli, sat through an hour-long class on Minnesota driving rules before taking the test.

Attendees included recent arrivals from Venezuela and El Salvador. They see a license as a path to driving, a higher earning potential that comes with it and as a way to obtain a legitimate form of identification. Sahan Journal is identifying attendees by first name only due to their immigration status.

Manuel, an attendee from Venezuela who has lived in Minnesota for about a year, said his feeling about living in the U.S. hasn’t changed despite Trump’s calls for more deportations and for ending programs like Temporary Protected Status that allow people fleeing certain countries to stay in the United States. He said he wants a license because life is much more difficult without a car.

Juan Carlos and his family came to Minnesota a year ago, and are enjoying life in St. Paul. His sister was living there, which made it an attractive destination. The city is spectacular, he said, although getting used to the weather is hard. He came to the United States to provide a better life for his three daughters. Juan Carlos worked as a chauffeur in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, and wants to be able to drive here. He’s looking forward to having a local ID.

“It’s really important,” he said.

Juan Carlos believes people from countries in distress like his will continue to immigrate to the United States no matter who is president. They have an obligation to their children to pursue a better life, he said.

Protections in place

Minnesota’s Driver’s License for All law has safeguards, including data protections, so that law enforcement who check a driver’s license during a traffic stop cannot access immigration data. Federal immigration authorities like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are barred from accessing immigration data through driver’s licenses unless they obtain a warrant, according to DVS.

Trump campaigned on mass deportations, and recently announced plans to appoint Tom Homan to a role he called “border czar,” that will oversee those removals. Homan was appointed as interim-director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the first Trump administration, but was never confirmed by the Senate.

Fears about the federal government using driver’s license information to access information about immigration status arose in the first Trump administration. In late 2019, after New York and New Jersey allowed undocumented residents to obtain licenses, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security sent a memo requesting a study on how those laws impacted enforcement efforts.

ICE has used state driver’s license databases while attempting to identify people in photos in Utah, Vermont and Washington, the Washington Post reported in 2019. The paper reported on a similar practice in Maryland in 2020.

Minnesota has good protections against federal immigration officials using driver’s license data, but they don’t necessarily safeguard against the federal government violating the law, said Julia Decker, policy director of the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota.

It’s unknown what will come of Trump’s campaign promises, Decker said, but threats to immigrants should be taken seriously. States can add protections, but they can’t always stop the federal government from accessing information, she said.

“The reality is that anytime that we as residents are providing our information to any government entity, there is a non-zero possibility that information could fall into another government entity’s hands,” Decker said."

It’s hard to know exactly what will happen until he takes office in January, according to local immigration experts. They worry about the potential impact on Minnesota’s immigrant communities — from undocumented immigrants to asylum-seekers to those on work or student visas to green-card holders.

Trump’s immigration promises mirror those of his first term, including the mass deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants and a tightening of the border. He has also said that he would cap immigration, limit asylum claims, require loyalty tests at the border and roll back President Joe Biden’s immigration decisions.

Michele Garnett McKenzie, advocacy director at The Advocates for Human Rights, expressed concern that the return of Trump’s immigration policies could happen “very quickly” because going back to the same set of procedures could be “fairly easy to reinstate.”

The Advocates for Human Rights provides legal representation in the Upper Midwest for people seeking asylum, those detained by U.S. immigration authorities, unaccompanied minors and trafficked victims.

Some of his plans for his next term include hiring thousands more Border Patrol agents, using the military for border security, raising the bar for those seeking asylum, and ending citizenship given to children born in the United States of undocumented immigrants, among other proposals.

Here is an overview of Trump’s promises on immigration and what it could mean for immigrants in Minnesota:

Temporary protected status and asylum seekers

During Trump’s second term, he would have the authority to decide whether to renew temporary protected status (TPS) for immigrants from 16 designated countries, allowing them to legally stay in the U.S. for at least six months at a time. TPS is granted when the Department of Homeland Security deems it too dangerous for individuals to return to their home countries.

Countries with TPS include Somalia, Sudan, Haiti, Honduras, Venezuela and Burma/Myanmar. Minnesota, which has the largest Somali and Karen communities in the country, could see hundreds of people lose their status.

Ana Pottratz Acosta, a clinical law instructor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said that one of Trump’s first priorities might be to end TPS for some of these countries.

During his first term, he tried to terminate TPS for six countries, including Haiti, El Salvador, Nepal, and Honduras, but was blocked by legal challenges and administrative delays. When Biden took office, he reversed Trump’s actions by extending or redesignating TPS for these countries, temporarily restoring protections.

Trump has also tried to end other temporary relief programs. In 2017, Trump attempted to end a program that allows young adults protection from deportation and gain work authorization for two years — which can be renewed. But his decision was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

But the current U.S. Supreme Court could be more favorable to Trump’s actions because of his appointments in his first term, Pottratz Acosta said.

During his 2024 campaign, Trump promised to reinstate several of his previous policies that could narrow the eligibility criteria and increase barriers for some seeking to change their immigration status or gain asylum, a form of protection from persecution or human rights violations in another country.

For example, he plans to reinstate the “public charge rule” which means that if an individual is likely to rely on public benefits, like food stamps, their application for a green card or visa could be denied.

Another policy he plans to reinstate is the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which requires those seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border to stay in Mexico as they wait for their U.S. court hearings.

Garnett McKenzie said the policy changes limited access to asylum, but also caused harm to the many migrants stranded at the border in unsafe conditions.

“It was the situation [where] people were left in this precarious waiting limbo, and human suffering and misery would be expected to be expanded if Remain in Mexico was put back into place,” she said.

Mass deportations

Trump has pledged in all three of his campaigns to deport millions of immigrants from the U.S. His plans to do so fell through during his first term; U.S. deportations hit their highest point in 2013, under then-President Barack Obama.

But this time around, Trump has more specifics on how he plans to carry out the deportations.

Trump tweeted last month that when he takes office, he plans to carry out “Operation Aurora” which will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 that gives presidents the authority to detain or deport noncitizens from a hostile nation during times of war or conflict.

He didn’t name a specific group as a target in his tweet, besides “every migrant criminal network operating on American Soil.”

But immigration legal experts say that any attempt to invoke blanket laws targeting immigrants can be challenged through the court system.

Abigail Wahl, attorney at Puerta Grande Law Firm in Minneapolis, said Trump has repeatedly said he wants to conduct mass deportations, but he knows that he’ll be facing legal barriers, lack of manpower, and would inflict harm to the economy by removing undocumented workers, who fill many jobs Americans have rejected.

“So I think that’s an intimidating measure,” she said.

Trump has said he plans to use the National Guard and local police to carry out his deportation plan. But it is possible that local elected officials and pushback from the community can stop the Trump administration from deputizing and involving local law enforcement in his deportation plan, Garnett McKenzie said.

In his first campaign for president in 2016, Trump made the same promise to deport all undocumented immigrants in the nation. Deportations during Trump’s first term actually dropped compared to the Obama administration, and the Biden administration deported similar numbers of immigrants as Trump. Trump’s incoming “border czar” Tom Homan has promised more deportations this time compared with Trump’s first term.

“Moving the government toward a particular policy change takes time and effort,” said Julia Decker, a policy analyst at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota. “It’s not something that can necessarily happen overnight.”

Immigration courts and detention

At Minnesota’s only federal Immigration Court located in Fort Snelling, there are 42,000 pending cases and it often takes years for some cases to move through the system. Since the Immigration Court is a part of the U.S. Department of Justice, Trump has the authority to nominate the person in charge of the Department of Justice that will put in place policy changes that influence the outcome of cases.

Some of these policies could be caseload quotas to speed up case resolutions and changes to performance review standards for immigration judges. The head of the U.S. Department of Justice would also have the authority to implement stricter interpretation of existing laws on immigration.

During Trump’s first term, Garnett McKenzie said local immigration judges were “fairly resilient” in making their decisions on a case-by-case basis, but she warned that court policies “can really affect how they can do their jobs.”

Wahl said she saw an increase in people held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers without bond and that detainees had fewer exceptions for release on their own recognizance in Trump’s first term.

In his second term, Trump has promised to expand the use of expedited removal, a process that allows immigration authorities to quickly deport non-citizens without a formal court hearing before an immigration judge. This would apply to noncitizens arrested within a 100 miles of a land or sea border who cannot prove they’ve continuously lived in the U.S. for two weeks or more.

He also said he intends to remove the 100-mile limitation and extend the two-week time period to two years.

Sanctuary cities

St. Paul and Minneapolis have passed ordinances that prohibit city employees, including police, from asking people their immigration status. Last year, the North Star Act that would have made Minnesota a sanctuary state, preventing police from cooperating with ICE, did not pass.

“It simply means that if you go to the police as a crime victim, you’re not questioned on your immigration unless you disclose that,” McKenzie said. “It’s designed to make sure that our communities feel safe in accessing our public safety system.”

Sanctuary cities could have federal funding threatened as a tool to urge them to work with immigration authorities, she said. In 2017, Trump did make an attempt to block federal funding to sanctuary cities, but he was unsuccessful.

Birthright citizenship

Trump has pledged to issue an executive order redefining birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed through the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The 14th Amendment states “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The birthright citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has been widely interpreted to apply to anyone born in the United States, regardless of the citizenship or immigration status of their parents.

This right is strengthened by a landmark 1898 Supreme Court ruling that found that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese nationals, was guaranteed citizenship under the birthright citizenship clause, Acosta said.

Yet in his most recent campaign for the White House, Trump promised to issue an executive order that would require one of the parents to be a citizen or permanent resident before their children can be considered citizens.

Acosta said she believes the strategy of the incoming Trump administration is to force the issue back to the Supreme Court in hopes that the court sets a new precedent in interpreting the birthright citizenship clause.

Ideological screening of immigrants

Trump has promised to enforce “strong ideological screening” for any immigrant entering the U.S., with a particular focus on “automatically disqualifying” those who show “sympathy for jihadists, Hamas, or Hamas ideology.”

His administration will have an ability to do so, Acosta said.

The laws allowing the federal government to do so are already on the books. One of them is the Patriot Act, which went into law after the September 11 attacks and greatly expanded the government’s ability to surveil all of those living within its borders.

Immigration forms also already ask questions that try to gauge a person’s ideological leanings. The current form for asylum, for example, asks applicants if they or their family members have ever been associated with “a political party, student group, labor union, religious organization, military or paramilitary group, guerrilla organization, ethnic group, human rights group, or the press or media.” It then asks for a detailed description of the applicant’s association with any of these types of organizations.

“You can see that it’s a broad, sort of amorphous thing,” the Immigrant Law Center’s Julia Decker said.

Workplace raids

Homan, Trump’s incoming “border czar,” has promised raids on workplaces that employ undocumented immigrants.

Workplace raids in Minnesota and Iowa made headlines during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.

In particular, Acosta remembers the Swift raids conducted in 2006 by ICE against Swift & Company meatpacking plants under Bush. ICE agents conducted one of the raids in a Worthington, Minnesota-based plant that left 239 workers detained and several kids in the city without caregivers.

ICE also conducted workplace raids under the Obama administration, usually going after employers who hired people without work authorization, Acosta said.

The first Trump administration didn’t focus much on workplace raids, she said, although it did engage in “fear-mongering” on the issue.

“There was a lot of fear in those communities about workplace raids,” she said. “Fear, I think, is like a huge element of what they’re going to do.”

How will Trump’s win impact Minneapolis police reform plans? One scholar says it could put a stop to progress.,https://sahanjournal.com/public-safety/minneapolis-police-reform-consent-decree-doj-trump-second-presidency/,2024-11-13,"Katrina Pross, More Katrina Pross, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_1817-1.jpeg,"Some community activists are worried that President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration could impact attempts to reform the Minneapolis Police Department through federal oversight.

Minneapolis is in the process of negotiating a federal consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which would make sweeping changes to how the city approaches policing. But some community members are concerned about what might happen to that agreement if it isn’t finalized before Trump is inaugurated on January 20.

“I’ve been working for 35 years to get the DOJ to come here and do a consent decree, and I feel like now it’s not going to happen in my lifetime,” said Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality. “I’m very worried about it. I’m very upset about it.”

The city entered a separate state consent decree with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights (MDHR), which a judge approved in July 2023. The agency began investigating Minneapolis and its police department after George Floyd was murdered by police in 2020, and found that the city and police department had a pattern of violating the state’s civil rights law. The state report found that the department’s accountability measures were deficient, and that there were racial disparities in how police used force.

In June 2023, the DOJ announced that it found the city and the police department in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The DOJ investigation concluded that Minneapolis police regularly used excessive force and discriminated against Black and Indigenous people.

Minneapolis Community Safety Commissioner Todd Barnette said in a written statement that he can’t discuss the timeline of the consent decree process, but that the city has been meeting with the DOJ on a regular basis to negotiate.

“Our focus is to ensure that our efforts result in effective, meaningful, and sustainable reform,” the statement reads in part. “Our commitment is not tied to political cycles, but rather to the enduring principle that every person deserves to be treated with dignity, equality, and respect. But we cannot rush this process.”

Some community members say it’s too soon to know the fate of Minneapolis’ federal consent decree. But one expert says Trump’s last presidency provides a warning for how things could play out.

Chicago: a case study

There was a “stark” decline in investigations into police departments during Trump’s last term compared to other administrations, said Christy Lopez, a professor from practice at Georgetown Law. Lopez also previously worked for the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division during President Barack Obama’s administration.

“Republican administrations have been less supportive of this work than Democrat administrations, but never has there been such a complete abdication of the federal enforcement role as there was under Donald Trump,” Lopez said.

The DOJ launched one investigation into police departments under Trump. President Joe Biden’s administration launched 12 DOJ investigations, including the one into Minneapolis police that resulted in the pending federal consent decree.

The federal government was noticeably absent in the immediate aftermath of the police killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor during Trump’s presidency, Lopez said. Floyd and Taylor were both killed in 2020, but the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments weren’t investigated until Biden took office in 2021.

“Everyone’s in the streets, everyone’s concerned about policing, and it’s just complete crickets from the Civil Rights Division,” Lopez said of how Trump’s administration handled the Floyd and Taylor killings. “There’s everything to indicate that [Trump’s new administration] will be even more hostile to this work.”

Lopez said if Minneapolis’ consent decree agreement isn’t finalized with the federal government before Trump takes office, it’s likely that the DOJ will no longer work toward negotiating an agreement. That’s what happened in Chicago when Trump first took office in 2017, she added.

In reaction to the DOJ’s inaction in Chicago, the Illinois attorney general stepped in and successfully sued the city in federal court to initiate a federal consent decree. Such action was unprecedented at the time, Lopez said.

A spokesperson for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office said the state consent decree will be unaffected by the federal consent decree process, and that Ellison is watching the negotiations “with interest.”

What is a consent decree?

A consent decree is a legally binding agreement enforced by a court between the investigative agency and the city. An independent monitor oversees how reforms outlined in an agreement are carried out by the police department and city.

Lopez said that based on her previous work on consent decrees, an agreement is usually reached within a year of an investigation’s public release. It’s “unfortunate,” she said, that Minneapolis’ federal consent decree hasn’t been finalized yet, given the high-profile nature of Floyd’s murder, which sparked days of protest across the world.

Barnette said that the DOJ didn’t open the negotiations process until June 2024. The negotiations process begins once the DOJ presents a draft of the consent decree to the city.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Twin Cities civil rights attorney and founder of the Racial Justice Network, said the process should have been expedited.

“That’s been disappointing, seeing such a long delay and not being given an explanation as to why the process is taking so long,” she said. “I’m not sure if it’s the city’s fault or if it’s the DOJ’s fault, but at the end of the day, it’s the residents who suffer, regarding this delay.”

The city isn’t legally obligated to make changes if there’s no finalized agreement, Lopez said.

“Consent decrees are the only vehicle for obtaining broad, forward-looking, legally mandated remedies against a police department,” she said. “They allow you to demand or require from defendants that they make changes to actually prevent harm in the future.”

Barnette said Minneapolis is the only city in the country that could be under a state and federal consent decree.

“This is a complex process,” Barnette said in his written statement. “I have and continue to view this as a top priority.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has previously said that he was against the city entering into two different consent decrees. In a statement Tuesday, a spokesperson from Frey’s office said the mayor is committed to negotiating a federal consent decree.

“Delivering on meaningful reform – both through and beyond agreements with the state and federal governments – has been and will remain one of the mayor’s top priorities, regardless of who is in the White House,” the statement reads in part.

Gross said it’s essential that the city enter into two consent decrees, as the state agreement only holds the city to the terms of the Minnesota Human Rights Act.

“That’s very good, but it doesn’t incorporate everything we need to address about policing,” she said of the state consent decree. “We need that ability to get at the bigger picture of what’s going on with Minneapolis police.”

A federal consent decree would also likely be enforced for a longer amount of time than the state agreement, which is currently set to last four years. Federal consent decrees usually last about seven to 10 years, Lopez said.

Johnathon McClellan, president of the Minnesota Justice Coalition, said he hopes the city will be able to finish its negotiations soon. He urged city leaders to get the work done.

“This fully falls on the shoulders of the city and what direction they want to go,” he said. “We all know change is hard, but it’s necessary, period. And so they’re gonna have to make a decision. But at the end of the day, I still think this happens.”"

Minnesota has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate consistently since the 1976 election. However, Minnesota, along with the majority of the nation, saw a red shift at the top of the 2024 ballot. In Minnesota, Trump decreased the vote margin from a 7.1 percentage point Democratic lead in 2020 to 4.2 points. This is the closest vote margin the Republican party has seen in Minnesota since 2016.

Trump also successfully flipped four counties from blue to red on Minnesota’s map. Blue Earth County, Carlton County, Nicollet County and Winona County – where President Joe Biden won in 2020 – voted Republican in the presidential race this year.

Almost all Minnesota counties shifted more Republican in the 2024 presidential election than in 2020. In addition, Trump made sizable gains in counties where Harris took the lead. For instance, Ramsey County voters voted 2.24 points more Republican than in the 2020 election. Only two out of nine counties that voted blue saw slight increases – both under one percentage point – in the Democratic lead.

Here’s an interactive map showing how counties swung Republican in this election.

What is an electoral swing and how to calculate it? An electoral swing shows the extent of change in voter support from one election to another, expressed as a positive or negative percentage point. It is calculated by taking the sum of the change in vote share of both parties, then dividing by two. Swing = (2024 Dem. vote share - 2020 Dem. vote share) + (2024 Rep. vote share - 2020 Rep. vote share) / 2 Since the presidential race includes more than two parties on the ballot, both parties can simultaneously make gains in vote share in an electoral district. In the interactive map shown above, the color of the arrows represents the party that made more gains in voter support compared to 2020. The size of the arrows shows how much the support for the Republican or Democratic candidate shifted from 2020 to 2024.

‘We can build a movement’: Activists plan to push back on Trump plans targeting immigrants,https://sahanjournal.com/immigration/immigrant-groups-organize-against-trump-mass-deportation-plan/,2024-11-08,"Elza Goffaux, Alfonzo Galvan, More Elza Goffaux, More Alfonzo Galvan, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PostElectionProtest_002-2.jpg,"On the Lake Street corner where Edwin, an undocumented Ecuadorian, waits for work, he’s heard two responses since former President Donald Trump was re-elected this week.

One is fear, from undocumented workers or asylum-seekers who fear they will be deported.

The other is support for Trump — from day laborers with green cards who say there is too much competition for too few jobs.

Twin Cities immigrant rights and legal groups, meanwhile, say they’ve been flooded with calls since Trump’s re-election.

During his campaign, Trump promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, put an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and curtail the use of temporary protected status, which allows immigrants to live and work in the U.S. if conditions are unsafe in their home country.

Minnesota immigrant rights groups say they plan to push back on the anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies they fear are coming. They have already swung into action, educating immigrants about their rights, forming crisis legal teams to halt deportations, helping undocumented immigrants get driver’s licenses, and pushing for state action, like passage of the North Star Act.

Edwin, 37, spent the last seven months standing on the sidewalk on Lake Street near Interstate 35W that workers call “la parada” or “la oficina,” Spanish for “the stop” or “ the office.”

While he has already started the asylum process and hopes that provides him some protection if new laws are put in place, he says many of those on the corner don’t have that buffer.

“In the case of my colleagues here, they do have that fear because they don’t know if they will be deported,” he said.

‘Always attacking us immigrants’

On Wednesday, when Donald Trump’s victory was confirmed, Ma Elena Gutierrez, executive director of Fe y Justicia, received many calls from other immigrants, who like Edwin, were wondering what they should do from now on, or what will happen if they get deported. Gutierrez tried to reassure them and promised that they will continue to organize.

“I feel concerned, there are a lot of exaggerated measures that I heard he (Trump) wants to implement, ” she said. “And that’s the rhetoric, everything he has talked about during this election has always been attacking us immigrants.”

Fe y Justicia provides legal help and health care services for immigrant workers and their families in central Minnesota. Gutierrez said the nonprofit will keep training workers and informing immigrants of their rights.

She remembers when the border patrol showed up to people’s workplaces during the first Trump presidency. The community was scared, and Gutierrez said that fear also passed down to the children. Members of the community did not report racist crimes out of fear.

On the day after the election, Pablo Tapia, executive director of Asemblea de Derechos Civiles (ADDC), brought a group of people to pass the Minnesota drivers license test, as part of the state’s Drivers Licence for All program. Six out of seven people passed the test, and Tapia said some of them cried with joy.

Tapia said ADDC is also planning to inform the community about their rights, and organize workshops to make sure the community is safe.

“We are just going to have to be very proactive, creative and fearless,” Tapia said. “A lot of people know what to do, but there are a lot of newcomers, and those are the ones we want to reach, they are the priority.”

During the previous Trump presidency, activists and immigrant groups in Minnesota had deployed different strategies to defend immigrant rights; placarding “know your rights” signs on police cars, or setting up rapid response teams in case of deportations by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“We have to leave the fear, because with fear, we cannot achieve this,” Gutierrez said. “What we want is to be safe.”

Micaela Schuneman, senior director of immigration and refugee services at the International Institute of Minnesota, remembers that fear was already a tactic used by the Trump administration in 2016.

“One of the things that we learned from the first Trump administration is that they stoked a lot of fear in immigrant communities,” she said. “They used very inflammatory language to create a sense of fear, to create a sense of instability.”

The future administration does not have the infrastructure to carry out mass deportation as it promised, said Schuneman, at least not as quickly. However, in addition to scaring communities, Trump might go back to other policies he implemented during his first term in office.

“The most immediate change that impacted our work directly was to reduce the number of refugees that we resettled each year,” said Schuneman. “We anticipate that it would be something he would want to do again; he has said that he wants to reduce the number of refugees that enter the United States.”

Pushing back on fear

Agencies will resettle up to 125,000 refugees in the United States in fiscal year 2025, and the International Institute of Minnesota will keep providing its services. The Immigrant Law Center will do the same. Its policy director, Julia Decker, stressed that the law remains as it was before the election.

“Nothing in the immigration law has changed even though the election has happened and we know with a fair amount of certainty that there will be a new administration in January. Nothing right now has actually changed in terms of the immigration laws or processes,” Decker said.

She said while there’s been some declarations of what Trump’s immigration policy could look like, nothing has been set in stone.

Decker said that uncertainty can cause some stress or anxiety for some people but the recommendation is to fact-check with a legal expert anything people hear regarding immigration cases.

Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid has already scheduled community outreach sessions. On Nov. 13 they’ll be at Waite House and on CareerForce on Lake Street. Some of the sessions will be focused on immigration court.

Danielle Hendrickson, managing attorney for Mid-Minnesota, also said the group is planning additional educational sessions for December to teach community members how Trump’s proposed policies could affect them.

Edwin said it’d be helpful for more people to hear from an expert. He said lack of reliable information among the group of laborers has led to increased arguments since the election.

“There are many things that my colleagues don’t know and that’s why they have that fear,” he said.

COPAL, a Latino advocacy organization, said Trump’s threat of mass deportations isn’t the first time immigrant communities have been targeted.

Wendy Zúñiga, communication director for COPAL, said the fear comes from past experiences.

COPAL’s executive director, Francisco Segovia, said he remembers seeing the impact and fear in the Latino community after the 2006 ICE raids at the Swift meat-processing plant in Worthington.

The group has been focused on helping undocumented Minnesotans obtain their drivers license since the passing of the Drivers License for All law.

But with Trump’s re-election they expect to do other work as well.

“We’re also working on creating pamphlets and documents to help fight that psychological fear that comes with a new president that, for some reason, is not targeting your demographic in a positive way,” Zúñiga said.

Segovia said Latinos across the country, regardless of documentation status, could be affected by Trump’s victory given his rhetoric.

“People who have those biases will look at us all in the same way,” Segovia said.

But on a state level, local rights groups still hope to make a difference. If Democrats hold enough seats in the Minnesota House, activists plan to push the North Star Act again. During the last legislative session, the DFL trifecta failed to pass this bill that aimed to make Minnesota a sanctuary state for immigrants and prevent police from cooperating with ICE on deportations. This is already the practice in Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“They need to make it their No. 1 priority to protect immigrants on a state level, because they won’t have that protection on the federal level,” said Erika Zurawski, co-founder of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC).

The group also plans to push for temporary protected status for Ecuadorian immigrants while President Joe Biden is still in office.

MIRAC participated in a Minneapolis protest on the day after the election along with multiple activist groups. Demonstrators condemned anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, attacks on reproductive rights and police violence as well as the ongoing Israeli aggression on Gaza.

“The Republicans will try to pass federal legislation that will be very harming to a lot of people, and not just immigrants, [but] trans rights, women’s rights, we should be watching out for attacks on voting rights, especially for African Americans,” said Zurawski. “We can stay strong together, we can build a movement that makes it very hard for this government to do its day-to-day work.”"
"Election Day: Minnesota voters head to the polls with economy, social issues in mind",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/election-day-minnesota-voters-polls/,2024-11-05,"Atra Mohamed, Alfonzo Galvan, Mohamed Ibrahim, More Atra Mohamed, More Alfonzo Galvan, More Mohamed Ibrahim, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElectionDay2024_1-8792.jpeg,"Minnesota voters took to the polls Tuesday, motivated by a variety of issues in casting their ballots for offices ranging from U.S. president to local school boards.

While the face-off between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is top of mind for most voters, several posts are up for grabs across the state, including congressional offices, state judges and all seats in the Minnesota House of Representatives, among others.

Many voters said Tuesday that the state of the economy, the cost of living and social issues from LGBTQ rights to abortion were key influences in how they cast their votes in the presidential election.

Naima Mohamoud, a Harris voter at the Brian Coyle Center in Minneapolis, said it was her first time voting in a U.S. election. “I’m voting for Kamala because she’s going to be the first woman president, and she is good to the immigrant people.”

“The race is very close, and sometimes I worry if Trump wins what will happen to the people he’s going to deport.”

Perry Sautbine, 66, said prices have gone up on everything from utilities to gas and groceries, prompting him to vote for Trump because he believes the former president can provide some relief.

“I’m struggling, and I’ve never had that problem before,” he said.

Elections officials in Minnesota accepted about 1.2 million absentee ballots as of Tuesday morning, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State. Officials distributed about 1.4 million absentee and mail ballots since early voting began on September 20, the office said.

All absentee and mail ballots must be received by 8 p.m. Tuesday to count; about 128,000 ballots haven’t been returned, the Secretary of State said early Tuesday afternoon.

“Minnesotans are encouraged to return their ballots in-person to their local election office as soon as possible to ensure their vote is counted,” the office said. “It is no longer recommended to return a mail or absentee ballot by mail.”

Voting through ‘rain, sleet or snow’

Jarnesha Woods took a break from work during a chilly, rainy morning to register to vote at the Eden Prairie Library.

During the 2020 race between Trump and Joe Biden, COVID-19 kept Woods from the polls, but this time she said “rain, sleet or snow” wouldn’t keep her away.

“I don’t want things to go back to chaos,” she said.

The economy and its recovery since the pandemic were her biggest concerns.

Woods said some around her have expressed support for Trump due to the belief he was responsible for the stimulus checks. She said she’s been fighting against misinformation like that for weeks now.

“I didn’t want us to go back to COVID ways, times were hard and we’re just now getting back to regular,” she said.

Eden Prairie resident Deepti Patel said voting was a family affair and she’d be doing it at 2 p.m. along with the rest of her family.

She said she was optimistic about the future of the country regardless of the election’s outcome and hasn’t yet experienced election fatigue, but she did have one concern — Trump.

Would jobs actually increase under his economic proposals, she asked.

At a historic moment, divides on display

Sautbine, a retiree, cast his ballot at the Rice Street Library in St. Paul, voting for Trump for the third time. He said the climate around this election and the attacks directed at candidates and their supporters is the worst he’s ever seen.

“It’s absolutely terrible and volatile, and I’ve never heard such hateful words — Hitler, commies, rapists,” he said. “The language is awful, and it really doesn’t need to be that way.”

Michael Binns, a 56-year-old elementary school teacher, said he sees a stark racial divide this election fueled by Trump’s rhetoric, which Binns said harkens back to America in the 1960s, and gives a platform to racist ideas. Binns said Trump, whose platform includes deporting asylum seekers and who spread misinformation about Haitians eating pets in Ohio, is using racism and fear-mongering as his way back to the White House.

“[Trump supporters] are not voting on issues of policy or anything else. They are voting on the issue of race,” Binns said. “Mainly, it comes to a point where you’re asking, ‘Are you going to elect this Black woman? Or are you going to like Trump — this European who basically had his time in office and didn’t do anything he promised he was going to do.’”

Binns voted for Harris. He said he agrees with most of her proposed platform, despite disagreement with some policies, like a potential capital gains tax. Binns described Trump’s platform as incoherent, and said his lack of substantive policy positions and criminal record should disqualify him.

“Basically, are you voting for? A criminal, or are you voting for Kamala Harris, who fights crime? That’s what it boils down to,” he said.

Longtime Democrat turns Republican

Muna Mohamud, a 43-year-old public school employee, has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee since she became eligible to vote 20 years ago. But, she said, she cast her vote at the Brian Coyle Community Center in Minneapolis for Trump, going against how most of her friends and family plan to vote in this election.

Mohamud said she believes Trump is worse than Harris on several issues, including his rhetoric about migrants, but she cited more alignment between her Muslim faith and the Republican Party platform on issues like abortion and gay rights.

“My religion is opposed to abortion and things to do with LGBTQ,” she said in Somali. “With the younger generation of kids, since I work in a school, being taught about LGBTQ issues and abortion, I said to myself, ‘Trump has my vote.’”

Badal Kariye, a writer and entrepreneur, said many of his family members and friends are voting for Harris, but he chose Trump as the next president. Kariye said he recognizes that Trump regularly lies, but he feels Democrats lie as well by promising to improve things for workers and not following through.

“Democrats have been in charge for four years; nothing has changed and workers still aren’t making enough,” Kariye said in Somali.

University of Minnesota student William Hopp, 21, echoed Kariye, saying his vote for Trump Tuesday morning was motivated by the current economic state of the country. As the cost of goods and services rise amid stagnating wages, Hopp said he believes Democratic policies like a child tax credit don’t apply to him as a young, single man, while Trump’s focus on the economy resonates with him.

“I just have more faith in him to better our economy,” Hopp said. “As you know, we’re in a pretty atrocious scenario right now. That was my main topic when focusing on who to vote for.”

Ali Ayanle, however, voted for Harris, remembering the Muslim ban Trump put in place in the early days of his first term in 2017.

“He put a ban on our people, Somali people and other Muslims,” Ayanle, 60, said in Somali. “Now he’s saying he wants to send back people who fled here from war, people who just got their papers.”

Trump’s rhetoric around immigration and his general divisiveness were the main motivators for Ayanle casting his ballot for Harris.

“He’s trying to divide up the American people — we’re here with documentation, we were welcomed here, we’re Americans too,” he said. “Everyone’s the same, we all work together — Christian, Muslim, Black, white, we’re all Americans.”

‘I have daughters’

Social issues, including women’s rights, abortion and LGBTQ representation, drove many voters to the polls Tuesday.

Markeata Gibson, a Harris voter at the Rice Street Library, said she is very optimistic that the American people will make the right choice based on what they already know about Trump.

“I voted for Harris because I have daughters, and I want to make sure I set the example for them and also lead them to a world where they can make their own choices,” Gibson said.

“She’s the better force for me, even if I don’t agree with everything she’s proposing,” Gibson said, adding that she thought Harris would do more on issues such as health care, education, child care and abortion rights.

Voter Tiffany Oyen, a Republican, showed up at the Phillips Community Center in Minneapolis nervous about the outcome. She said her biggest worry is a win by Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

She said Harris has not followed through with the promises she made in the past four years, so she doesn’t think Harris should be in charge of the country.

When asked if she thinks Trump is trustworthy, she replied, “I know all the convictions that the Democrats planned to discredit Trump, but I’m willing to override that because I’d rather have him carry our nation for the next four years than her.”

St. Paul resident Kristen Vann said the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and Trump’s attacks on abortion rights, made her cast her ballot for Harris.

“I believe in women’s rights as far as the abortions he’s trying to ban, and the birth control he’s trying to ban,” she said.

Vann, who is Black, is nervous about the outcome of the presidential race, comparing the moment to former President Barack Obama’s election in 2008. If elected, Harris would be the first female president, and first president of South Asian descent.

Vann said some of her friends are voting for Trump because of financial relief like stimulus checks and Paycheck Protection Program loans that were issued early in the COVID-19 pandemic under his presidency.

“What they don’t know is that everything goes through Congress, even the stimulus checks — that’s nothing that he did by himself,” Vann said. “He just put his signature on it. Everything has to go through the House and the Senate, and I don’t think a lot of people understand that.”

‘Stress all around me’

Wilmer and Josue Chavez stepped out of the Powderhorn Recreation Center with an “I voted” sticker in hand and decided to take a photo for social media.

The two said social media played an important role in getting them out to vote. It was through Instagram, TikTok and Facebook that they began to form their stances on issues in the presidential race.

Both men voted for Harris.

“It’s about protecting women’s health,” Wilmer said.

It was also about performing their civic duties, especially as members of the Latino community, according to Josue.

“It feels like my responsibility towards my community, voting for the people that can’t,” he said.

However, both men agreed they could’ve done more research on races outside of the presidential election.

“The feeling was really heavy inside that room [polling place],” Wilmer said.

According to Josue, there’s a level of exhaustion he’s seen at work and in his personal life related to the election and those feelings won’t go away until the results come out, however long that may take.

“People felt the pressure, there was stress around me,” Josue said. “Yes, I feel stressed.”"

All seats in the Minnesota House of Representatives are also up for grabs and one seat in the state Senate will feature a special election. Democrats narrowly control both branches in the Minnesota Legislature, which Republicans could potentially take after ballots are counted.

This is true even for the state Senate, which Democrats held control of by only one seat until state Senator Kelly Morrison, DFL-Deep Haven, resigned earlier this year to focus on her candidacy for Congress. A special election in the west Twin Cities suburban seat will determine if Democrats or Republicans control the Senate.

There are also several city and county races across the state.

Election Day is Tuesday, November 5, 2024. Sahan Journal breaks down everything you need to know about casting your ballot on Election Day in Minnesota.

Where do I vote in person on Election Day?

Go to your designated polling place, which you can find by visiting the Secretary of State’s website here: https://pollfinder.sos.state.mn.us.

How do I register to vote on Election Day?

Minnesota allows same-day registration. Go to your designated polling place and bring one of the following proof of residence:

A valid I.D. with your current address listed on it, which can include a driver’s license, a learner’s permit or a receipt for either if you are waiting for them in the mail.

An expired I.D. and a bill, lease agreement or student fee statement showing your current address. If you are living in student housing, an expired I.D. will be enough to allow you to register to vote.

A person who can vouch for where you live. This can be a housemate or neighbor who is able to tell the poll worker that you live at the address you use to register to vote. All they need to do is tell the poll worker that you live where you say you live.

If you live in the same precinct as you voted in the last election but moved to a different home, you don’t need to bring anything to the polls with you; just tell the poll worker that you moved.

If you registered late, defined as within 20 days before Election Day, bring the Notice of Late Registration that you received in the mail with you to the polls.

When are the polls open?

Most polls around the state must open at 7 a.m. on Election Day. Towns with less than 500 people aren’t required to open polls until 10 a.m.

Polls close at 8 p.m., but you can vote later as long as you are in line by 8 p.m.

What if I’m working all day on Election Day?

If you work during polling hours, state law allows you to take time off work on Election Day for the purpose of voting without using vacation or personal leave.

Employers who deny employees the right to vote are subject to misdemeanor charges. If your work violates this law, you are encouraged to file a complaint with your local county attorney.

Can I access ballots and other election materials in languages other than English?

All polling places in Minnesota are required to post voting instructions in Spanish, Hmong and Somali.

In all precincts where 3 percent or more of the precinct population speaks English “less than very well,” according to U.S. Census data, the polling place is required to carry instructions and sample ballots in the most commonly spoken languages in the precinct.

Can I request an interpreter at the polls?

Yes, but you must file a request in advance.

If you want an interpreter, you must live in a precinct where 20% or more of the population speaks English “less than very well.” You must then get 10 or more registered voters to sign a form from the Secretary of State’s Office asking for in-person interpretive services at your polling place on Election Day.

That form can be found here.

Where can I see a sample ballot?

You can view what your ballot will look like by entering your home address on the Secretary of State’s website here.

Can I call someone if I have more questions?

You can call the Secretary of State’s office at 1-877-600-VOTE (8683) or contact your county election office at this link.

If I forget to mail my absentee ballot before November 5, can I still return it before polls close?

You can drop off your absentee ballot in person at your county’s ballot drop box. Click here for a list of addresses for county drop boxes.

If you do not see your county listed, drop off your absentee ballot at the same election office that mailed your ballot. Voters have until 8:00 p.m. on November 5 to drop off their absentee ballots in person."
Minnesota election results: Ilhan Omar reelected to fourth term in Congress,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/election-2024/results-ilhan-omar-minnesota-fifth-congressional-district-dalia-al-aqidi/,2024-11-04,"Katrina Pross, More Katrina Pross, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ElectionDay2024_Party4-9240.jpg,"U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar easily won a fourth term in Congress on Tuesday night, beating Republican challenger Dalia al-Aqidi by more than 50 percentage points.

Omar received 75 percent of the vote compared to al-Aqidi’s 23 percent, with 195 of 217 precincts reporting, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office.

Omar declared victory on X, formerly Twitter, about 11 p.m.

“Thank you, CD5,” she wrote. “Our hard work was worth it. We knocked on 117,716 doors. We made 108,226 calls. And we sent 147,323 texts. This is a victory for ALL of us who believe that a better future is possible. I can’t wait to make you all proud over the next two years.”

At a DFL watch party in downtown St. Paul on Tuesday night, Omar said it has been the “honor of her life” to represent Minnesota’s Fifth District. She highlighted her past work in Congress, including work around immigration and addressing student debt.

The crowd erupted into cheers when she said a priority in her next term will be to “end the genocide in Gaza.”

After her speech, Omar briefly danced with supporters on stage.

Omar has represented the state’s Fifth Congressional District since 2019. The district includes Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, including Brooklyn Center, St. Louis Park and Richfield.

Omar beat Don Samuels, a former Minneapolis City Council member, in the August primary election by 13 percentage points. Omar also beat Samuels in the 2022 primary election. The district hasn’t elected a Republican since 1960.

Minneapolis resident Shukri Malin attended the DFL watch party at the InterContinental hotel Tuesday evening to support Omar and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate. Malin said it’s exciting to see more women and people of color in politics, and that she’s been pleased with Omar’s time in Congress.

“She’s good, she helps people,” Shukri said. “She helps everybody.”

Party attendee Fartun Abdi, of Minneapolis, voted for Omar. But, she said, she voted for former President Donald Trump on Tuesday because of the economy, among other issues.

“She’s from the same country I come from,” Fartun said of Omar. “I support her. We wear the same scarf, have the same religion.”

Before she was elected to Congress, Omar served one term in the Minnesota House of Representatives, and was the first Somali state legislator elected in the country. Omar was born in Somalia and fled the country’s civil war when she was 8 years old. After spending several years in a refugee camp in Kenya, she immigrated to the United States in the 1990s. She moved to Minneapolis in 1997.

Omar’s campaign has centered around her legislative accomplishments and her commitment to continue as a progressive member of Congress. Her campaign cites reforming the immigration system, protecting reproductive rights and preventing gun violence as priorities.

Al-Aqidi, a journalist and activist, told Sahan Journal before Election Day that she considers herself a “moderate Republican,” and hoped that would help her gain traction in a historically blue district.

“I’ve been talking to many, many moderate people and independents in our district, and these people need someone,” she said.

Omar told Sahan Journal prior to Tuesday that climate, affordable housing and student debt cancellation are her priorities. Omar added that she hopes that Democrats take back the majority in the House, and that she can return to the Foreign Affairs Committee and chair the African subcommittee.

Omar said Democrats are already strategizing for the possibility of Republicans taking control.

“We’ve already experienced a Trump presidency, and so we kind of know what some of those challenges will look like,” Omar said. “We also are really afraid of the prospect of having another January 6th.”

On Tuesday, Hiltsley received 65% of the vote, to 35% for Olson in the contest for House District 38A.

“I am excited, I cannot believe it, it is history in the making. We worked so hard getting to this point,” she said. “Now the work starts, the work of serving.”

“Together we will create a district that uplifts everybody, a district that truly feels like home.”

Supporters at her watch party in Brooklyn Park cheered her historic win Tuesday.

Monni Nyaribo, 28, a marketing and biological science student, said she was drawn to Hiltsley because of their shared Kenyan heritage.

“She is working on inclusivity and building a strong community, because within the African community everything is done together,” Nyaribo said.

Campaign volunteer Aaliyah Murray, 19, said Hiltsley is one of the first candidates she felt she could advocate for.

“She focuses on public safety and also the youth but without incriminating the youth, which I love,” Murray said.

District 38A, which was redistricted in 2020, is home to several immigrant communities. Thirty-three percent of the area’s inhabitants are Black, 18% Asian, 9% Hispanic and 38% white, according to 2022 U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Before the redistricting, the seat represented residents of Lino Lakes and part of Hugo and was reliably Republican. But Brooklyn Park and Osseo have been Democratic strongholds for more than 20 years.

Hiltsley, who works as a data security manager, beat Liberian American candidate Wynfred Russell in the August DFL primary. In 2022, she ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate.

In the final days before the election, Hiltsley sought to reach independent and swing voters, vowing to work across the aisle to “get things done for the district,” she said.

Hiltsley said she wants to make sure that everyone in the community feels safe, provide affordable housing and access to quality education, and create an environment where small businesses can thrive.

“People are super nervous about what’s going on nationally, but our message, and our campaign, continues to be rooted in local politics, because that’s what touches the average voter directly,” she said.

With 100% of precincts counted, Perryman had 56% of the vote to Daisane’s 43%. She won the seat by fewer than 200 votes two years ago.

Daisane, who owns a St. Cloud child care center, had hoped to flip the seat to Democrats, propelled by the region’s changing demographics. District 14A covers parts of St. Cloud, Waite Park and St. Augusta.

He’s one of the first candidates of color to win the DFL endorsement in central Minnesota.

Neither candidate had released a comment at publication time.

Perryman said during this campaign she has heard from voters on issues including the rising cost of living, tax increases and the burden of regulation on schools and small businesses.

“I plan to continue representing every resident in District 14A,” she said in a statement in September.

Born in Somalia, Daisane spent 18 years in a refugee camp in Kenya before immigrating to the United States in 2009.

In 2016, he ran for the St. Cloud City Council, but fell short.

He said that in this election, he was not thinking about losing. “We are all-in on this victory,” he said. “But if I do lose, I’ll take the time to be with my family, particularly bonding with my one-month-old daughter. Family comes first, and I’m grateful for their support through this entire process.”

Former teachers union president Greta Callahan won her race in southwest Minneapolis, defeating early childhood educator Lara Bergman.

Incumbent school board member Kim Ellison, who has served on the board since 2013, won reelection, defeating accountant Shayla Owodunni.

Incumbents Sharon El-Amin, representing north Minneapolis, and Adriana Cerrillo, who represents downtown and parts of south Minneapolis, both ran uncontested and easily won reelection.

A second new member will be appointed by current school board members on November 12, to fill a vacancy for a south Minneapolis position left open by Faheema Feerayarre’s resignation.

“I’m humbled to continue serving on the Minneapolis School Board,” Ellison said in a text message Tuesday night. “I look forward to working with community as the board makes tough decisions. I’m committed to our students and staff and thank the voters for their support.”

Callahan could not immediately be reached for comment.

Next year’s school board will have big decisions to make. The district is starting its process of “school transformation,” which could include closures and consolidations. At the same time, more than 2,500 new immigrant students have enrolled in Minneapolis Public Schools, stabilizing the district’s enrollment for the first time in years. Those new students could lead to increased state funding — but also increased costs, because the state does not fully fund English language services. The end of COVID relief funding meant significant budget cuts last year, and the district is expected to cut more this spring. On Tuesday, voters approved a $20 million levy to fund school technology, which should provide more funding but is not expected to stave off further budget cuts altogether.

Callahan said that Minneapolis neighborhood schools were special places and she’d “fight like hell” to keep them open. She said she wanted to focus on convincing the state and federal government to pay more for education.

Ellison said that the school district needed to “right-size” without compromising quality. She said that closing schools did not save much money, but that it might make sense for the district to consolidate programs.

Cerrillo said she planned to continue working with elected officials at all levels of government to increase funding for Minneapolis Public Schools. El-Amin said she hoped to focus on improving academics and literacy for Black and brown children.

Minnesota appears to be headed for divided government again, with control of the House split 67-67 in unofficial results.

In the Senate, Democrats have a one-seat majority after Ann Johnson Stewart won a special election in the western suburbs around Lake Minnetonka.

Republicans flipped at least three seats in the House, but need to four to gain control of the chamber. Many races remained uncalled late Tuesday night, and DFL candidates declared victory Wednesday in two tight races to determine control of the House.

DFL incumbents Representatives Brad Tabke, of Shakopee, and Dan Wolgamott, of St. Cloud, both announced victories in races that will head to official recounts before the results are certified.

Tabke is currently leading Republican challenger Aaron Paul by 13 voters in District 54A, according to unofficial results from the Minnesota Secretary of State. Wolgamott has a 28-vote unofficial lead over Republican Sue Ek.

A Republican victory in either contest would give the GOP control of the House of Representatives.

Those recounts will likely occur later in November, according to the Secretary of State. Wolgamott’s District 14A surrounding St. Cloud includes Benton, Sherburne and Stearns counties, which means recounts won’t happen until all those counties meet to certify results, sometime after November 21. Shakopee is in Scott County, which will certify its results on November 13.

Minnesota last had a tied House of Representatives in 1979, according to House archives.

Ahead of Tuesday’s vote, members of the DFL People of Color and Indigenous (POCI) Caucus campaigned across the state to turn out votes for Democrats, according to Rep. Jay Xiong, DFL-St. Paul, who won a fourth term.

Xiong led the caucus’ Asian American outreach effort and spent the weeks leading up to the election campaigning in his home district on St. Paul’s East Side and throughout the state.

“We know that every single vote in every single district matters,” Xiong said, ahead of Election Day.

The POCI worked to elect Democrats statewide and to ensure that current caucus members held their seats. New members included Huldeth Hiltsley, who won her race for District 38A, covering parts of Brooklyn Park and Osseo. She will be Minnesota’s first Kenyan American legislator .

But Somali American candidate Abdi Daisane failed to flip a central Minnesota seat in District 14B. Incumbent Bernie Perryman held onto her seat, which includes parts of St. Cloud, Waite Park and St. Augusta.

Democrats campaigned heavily on reproductive rights, and heard fears from voters about a federal abortion ban should Republicans retake national office.

Trump, who promised mass deportations if chosen as the country’s 47th president, led in victories early on Tuesday as votes were tabulated across the nation, but lost Minnesota to Harris. Nearly 51 percent of Minnesotans voted for Harris, continuing the state’s longtime blue streak; Trump earned a little over 46 percent of the state’s votes.



The Associated Press declared Trump’s national victory at 4:34 a.m. CST Wednesday.



Minnesotans at the DFL election watch party appeared subdued near midnight Wednesday when national results in the race remained uncertain. Meanwhile, voters at the state’s GOP party grew progressively more excited throughout the night as Trump made strides nationally and as they ticked off Republican victories across the country.

Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, held a lead over Trump in Minnesota throughout the night, but their national results looked dim, with Harris’ campaign saying near midnight that she would not speak on the issue Tuesday.

Several attendees lingered at the DFL party at the InterContinental hotel in downtown St. Paul near midnight.

Minneapolis City Council Member Jason Chavez, who remained late at the party, acknowledged that things didn’t look great for Harris and Democrats on the national level. But, he said, the DFL retaining the state Senate gives democrats some optimism.

“Obviously, it doesn’t feel good to see that we’re down right now, specifically for immigrant families who are fearful of the results of this election,” he said. “But no matter what happens tonight, we’re going to organize tomorrow and the next four years … to ensure that our communities are safe.”

Democratic Party presidential candidates have won Minnesota for the last half-century, the longest-running streak of any state for the party. But Republican presidential candidates came close to winning Minnesota a number of times since, most recently in 2016 when Trump lost to Hillary Clinton by under 2 percentage points.

Democrats are hoping the addition of Walz to the Harris ticket will continue Minnesota’s streak, and neither Harris nor Trump has treated Minnesota as a swing state this election season.

Minnesota DFL watch party

A crowd of supporters began trickling into the DFL watch party about 8:15 p.m. A DJ played club music in a ballroom as MSNBC’s election coverage was projected on a giant screen.

The party was packed by about 9 p.m., as some supporters mingled while others nervously watched the election returns. Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan spoke to the crowd around 10 p.m.



“It has been an honor to travel the country and this great state to talk about my buddy and our incredible Governor Tim Walz,” she said. “And to talk about our next President of the United States Kamala Harris.”

Flanagan would become the next governor of Minnesota if Harris wins the election. Walz is expected to watch tonight’s results with Harris in Washington, D.C.



“I want to be clear, whatever my job is tomorrow or a month from now, or a year from now, or 20 years from now, I will always be here to listen to your struggles and successes,” Flanagan said. “I will work to make the changes that we need here together in Minnesota. I will work with everyone to protect our rights and our freedoms.”

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter was the first speaker of the night and talked up Walz. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was also spotted in the crowd.

“Are you proud of our governor?” Carter asked to cheers from partygoers. “It’s an exciting opportunity, because one of the things we know in Minnesota is that elections have consequences.”

U.S. Senator Tina Smith addressed the group at about 9:45 p.m., telling them to be patient as results come in slowly. She said she had “no doubt” that Harris and Walz would win once all votes are counted.



“Tim and Kamala have reminded us that politics should be joyful,” she said. “Politics should be about what we can do together to really move our country in the direction that we want to move it.”

Several other DFL elected officials are expected to show up later, including

Attendee Neal Washington, 38, of St. Louis Park, said he was so confident Harris would win that he already booked a hotel to see the presidential inauguration in person.

“Honestly I’m feeling a little nervous, but not too much,” he said about waiting for election results. “I still feel like she’s gonna swing it out of the ballpark.”

Marva Dixon, 62, a teacher from New York, said she spent the last week door-knocking for Harris in the Twin Cities suburbs.

“I’m extremely nervous,” Dixon said. “I really want Kamala to win.”

David Mesta, 24, of Mankato, said his parents are Mexican immigrants who came to live in Minnesota.

“I think it’s important for people who come from an immigrant background to feel supported, not from Trump who’s been attacking Latino communities and making us feel that we’re a threat when we’re not,” he said.

Alex Juarez, 24, said he was nervous that Virginia, which has been a reliably blue state in recent presidential elections, hadn’t yet been called for Harris. But he said he’s hopeful about the final outcome.

Minnesota GOP watch party

A steady shuffle of GOP supporters donning sport coats and red Make America Great Again hats began to fill up the ballroom at the Radisson Blu in Bloomington on Tuesday night as the Minnesota Republican Party hunkered down to watch the election results.

The crowd kept finding new reasons to cheer as election results rolled in. The ballroom at the Radisson Blu erupted in applause late in the evening as Fox News called an Ohio race for Republican Bernie Moreno over incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat.

Republican Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach took the stage shortly after her race was called around 10 p.m. in Minnesota’s Seventh Congressional District, celebrating her win and saying that Republicans have a great chance to take the White House and the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

“Things are going our way,” Fischbach said.

Republicans got more good news at about 10:45 p.m., when Fox News’ projection for Trump to win North Carolina rang through the ballroom to a chorus of cheers. The buzz kept growing as CNN updated the audience on key races in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that all showed slight leads for Trump.

The largest roar yet came at 10:50 p.m. when Fox News projected that Republicans would take control of the U.S. Senate.

Elliott Blanchette, 31, broke political ranks from his Democratic family and became a Republican in 2014. He saw the Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and disagreed with what he called a Marxist ideology behind the movement. Blanchette, who is Black, felt more at home in the Republican party and has since become an ardent Trump supporter.

He wore a white hat with “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) written in gold stitching, along with an American flag shirt and shoes.

“I’m fully MAGA, all the way,” Blanchette said.

Sipping a glass of red wine, Blachette said he was feeling optimistic about Trump retaking the White House and flipping Minnesota to the Republicans.

David Hann, chair of the Republican Party of Minnesota, said he felt good about where the party stood as he awaited the night’s results. The party has been active in the western suburbs, Hann said, where a special election for Senate District 45 will determine if the upper chamber will remain in DFL hands by a one-seat margin. Democrat Kelly Morrison resigned from the seat to run for the Third Congressional District seat, opening up a race between Republican Kathleen Fowke and DFL-endorsed Ann Johnson Stewart.

The party worked to reach voters in Minnesota’s Somali and Hmong communities this election cycle, and made real progress, Hann said.

“We want the Somali folks to get to know Republicans and not just what the Democrats say about us,” Hann said.

Chip Bui, a conservative, said he was excited about the Republicans’ chances Tuesday. He began supporting Trump when he was a high school student in 2016, and has been active in state Republican politics since.

“I believe in freedom of speech, I believe in God, and you know, Trump is the choice for me,” Bui said.

Inspired by Trump, Jason Cook, 47, made the conversion from Libertarian to Republican in 2016. The north Minneapolis resident said he’s drawn to Trump’s anti-globalism, America-first policies. He is hoping for more Republican success in Minnesota.

“I want to see some change,” Cook said.

He’s hoping to see more conservatives in the Minnesota House, and is also supporting GOP candidate Royce White in his race against incumbent Senator Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.

Cook attended the party with Curt Dallaire. The men said they’ve seen a shift among their friends in the Somali community towards supporting Trump and other Republicans for cultural and economic reasons. But they worry about the integrity of the election process, and say they still feel the results of the 2020 election were not fairly tabulated, a claim made by Trump and conservatives that has been rejected in the courts.

“I’m hoping it’s too big to rig,” Cook said.

St. Paul resident Pao Lor was excited as he watched results trickle in. The 35-year-old has been a Republican for a decade, and wants to see Trump retake the White House. He feels Trump appeals to entrepreneurial people and those trying to lift themselves out of poverty. Trump offers a change from the current leadership, and is a known quantity, he said.

“They want somebody who is upfront and who they know what they’re getting,” Lor said of voters.

Election results: Angie Craig beats Joe Teirab in Minnesota’s Second District,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/election-2024/results-angie-craig-minnesota-second-district-joe-teirab/,2024-11-04,"Joey Peters, Andrew Hazzard, More Joey Peters, More Andrew Hazzard, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/6.png,"Incumbent Angie Craig, a moderate Democrat, beat Republican challenger Joe Teirab Tuesday to win her fourth term in the U.S. House of Representatives.



The race for Minnesota’s Second Congressional District was one of the most closely watched Congressional races in the state, and one of the more closely watched contests in the country.

Craig earned 55 percent of the vote with most precincts reporting. Teirab earned 42 percent.

Teirab, 37, a former federal prosecutor who was running in his first bid for public office, is the son of an immigrant from Sudan and ran on a moderate platform.

The race has possible implications for which political party wins or retains control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans held a slim nine-seat majority going into Election Day.

A steady shuffle of GOP supporters donning sport coats and red Make America Great Again hats began to fill up the ballroom at the Radisson Blu in Bloomington Tuesday night, as the Minnesota Republican Party hunkered down to watch the election results.

Before results were tabulated Tuesday, Teirab made an appearance at the GOP’s election watch party at the Radisson Blu in Bloomington, and said he felt good about his campaign and its closing message. Teirab, a former federal prosecutor and U.S. Marine, said he felt enthusiasm Tuesday at polling places in southern suburban cities like Farmington and Rosemount.

“I think people are going to want change,” Teirab said before Craig’s victory.

Teirab said he heard most from voters about the economy, and reiterated he is against a federal abortion ban, saying the issue should be decided by individual states.

Republican congressmen represented the district for most of this century, but that changed when Craig, 52, first won office in 2018. Since then, the district has started to shift toward Democrats, with President Joe Biden winning it by 7 percentage points in 2020. Trump won the district by 1 percentage point in 2016.

The Second District encompasses southern Twin Cities suburbs like Eagan, Shakopee and Burnsville and extends southwest to Northfield.

Most of Craig’s election wins have been close. But in that time, she’s amassed a campaigning machine that’s proved hard to beat, according to Erin Covey, an editor with the Cook Political Report.

According to the most recent campaign finance reports, Craig outraised Teirab by more than three times at $6.1 million to $1.7 million.

“She has become one of the strongest campaigners in the House Democratic Caucus,” Covey said.

Craig is one of the most moderate Democrats in the House, voting multiple times to condemn Biden’s U.S.-Mexico border policies. Craig hammered Teirab on his past advocacy against abortion rights in college and his seat on the board of a pregnancy support center that opposes abortion.

Teirab tried to counter Craig’s narrative by pledging to vote against any federal abortion ban. He took a moderate stance on immigration, supporting more funding for border patrol to curb illegal immigration but also to process backlogged applications for asylum seekers.

Teirab’s rhetoric on immigration sharply contrasts with Donald Trump.

“I think we can talk about the issue of immigration in a way that’s respectful when we’re not vilifying people who want to come here,” he told Sahan Journal in September.

"Anxiety ahead of 2024 election: How Minnesota mutual aid groups are preparing to respond, whatever the outcome",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/election-anxiety-2024-minnesota-immigration-rights-trans-mutual-aid/,2024-11-01,"Elza Goffaux, Alfonzo Galvan, More Elza Goffaux, More Alfonzo Galvan, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BlackVisionsLayout.jpg,"Last election cycle Yolanda Roth was overprepared. The organization she was working with had prepared a crisis plan that they did not need to use. But this election, the situation is more grim. Roth, who now works for the Black liberation organization Black Visions, is worried about targeted violence on Election Day.

“I would say now the danger, it just is,” Roth said. “Now it just feels like you can touch it, you can smell it, you can taste it — it is just there.” Depending on the outcome of the election, and its consequences, Roth knows the Black community will be able to rely on the network of mutual aid organizations Black Visions is connected to.

As the days tick down to the November 5 election, those involved in Twin Cities mutual aid and legal aid groups say they are witnessing anxiety in their communities. Activists are preparing for the day after, regardless who wins the presidency, to fill in gaps in access to resources and services.

“We are seeing the same horror movie again,” said Pablo Tapia referring to Donald Trump’s first presidency. Tapia founded the faith-based group Asamblea de Derechos Civiles (ADDC) 20 years ago and had organized the immigrant Latino community under the Trump administration. Once again, he is witnessing anxiety among his peers.

“It is hard to organize people when they are under fear,” Tapia said. “But it is a window to organize more effectively once you bring down the panic; sometimes you can bring something good out of it, which is the courage of the people, who stand in solidarity with each other and try to fight back and win.”

Stepped-up classes, legal help

Ahead of the election, ADDC has stepped up its driver’s license for all classes. If the DFL loses its majority in the Minnesota Legislature, the program could be overturned. The organization is also hoping to pass a bill to curb rent gouging and other unfair practices at mobile home parks, where many immigrants find housing.

If Trump wins and enacts his threat of mass deportations, ADDC will rely on strategies activists used in 2016. Tapia wants to set up rapid response teams in case of deportations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), reach out to white churches for support and keep telling the story of immigrant communities in Minnesota.

Legal aid groups and immigration attorneys say they are seeing an increase in calls about asylum cases, temporary protected status, refugee cases, DACA, family-based green card petitions and other immigration issues that could leave people vulnerable to deportation.

Abigail Wahl, attorney and owner of Puerta Grande Law Firm, said business has been brisk and she’s noticed that clients are more nervous when coming in for consults.

“That’s something that happens more frequently in election years,” she said. “Especially because people already lived through four years of one Trump administration. So there’s definitely anxiety about that.”

During the Trump administration, Wahl said processing time for immigration cases was delayed. Consulates and embassies abroad were also shut down, so a return to normal took longer than expected after President Joe Biden was elected.

It wasn’t until 2023 that case processing times returned to a pre-Trump norm, Wahl said. Because of that, she said she’s concerned about what immigration policies could look under a Kamala Harris presidency.

“I wouldn’t say that Harris is the most progressive person on immigration,” Wahl said. But she added, “as an immigration attorney, I would much rather practice under the Harris administration.”

Wahl said she was hopeful that the Biden administration would approve a TPS designation for Ecuadorians, but she feels Harris could be more open to granting or extending TPS, which could benefit immigrant communities.

Other local organizations also plan to push for a TPS designation for Ecuadorians, if Democrats return to the White House. Erika Zurawski, co-founder of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC), wants to put pressure on Biden in the months before he leaves office.

“The vast majority of immigrants that we’ve seen coming to Minnesota have been from Ecuador,” she said. “This is a Minnesota question, not just a national question.”

At the state level, Zuraswki said she has never been more frustrated than by the last legislative session, when the DFL had a trifecta in the House, Senate and governor’s office, but failed to pass the North Star Act. The bill aimed to make Minnesota a sanctuary state for immigrants and prevent police from cooperating with ICE on deportations. This is already the practice in Minneapolis and St. Paul.

“If Trump wins and they [DFLers] don’t hold the trifecta,” said Zurawski, “they are personally responsible for every single immigrant who gets deported from Minnesota in that Trump presidency.”

Post-election outreach sessions

At Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, managing attorney Danielle Hendrickson said her staff is gearing up for what comes next.

Until the outcome of the election is clear, her attorneys are reviewing cases, seeing which ones could be affected by a new administration and “trying to assess what moves and actions we should take” before January.

Hendrickson said clients still have time after the election to consult with an immigration attorney.

“The law of the land stays the law of the land until there’s that new administration. And so the election happens in November, but that new president is not actually sworn in until January, so any new policy changes cannot happen until after that new president is in place,” she said.

Even after the new president is sworn in, policy changes can take time, she said.

Wahl also said some of her clients have been put at ease after consults when she tells them that even under removal proceedings they do have legal defenses.

“I don’t think that people need to be hysterical about mass deportations. I do take Trump’s threats seriously, but I don’t think that they would be able to put that into effect,” she said.

Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid along with other immigration legal services providers have already scheduled post-election outreach sessions in the community, Hendrickson said.

During these sessions community members will be able to learn more about how the president-elect’s policies could impact them. Hendrickson said these sessions will start on November 13 and at least one will focus on immigration court.

But Zurawski says some changes since Trump’s presidency have made immigrants more vulnerable. More immigrants have entered the country through legal ports of entry and were processed at the borders. Some also benefited from programs like the humanitarian parole, promoted by the Biden administration. Zurawski said that has helped identify and map newly arrived immigrants, making deportation easier for a future Republican administration.

She condemns both parties’ anti-immigrant rhetoric, but will organize differently depending on who is elected.

“Under a Democratic presidency we try to be more proactive in terms of proposing certain legislation that could benefit people,” Zurawski said. “But under a Trump presidency, we’re always reacting to the next bad thing that happens.”

Impact on other vulnerable communities

Even if Minnesota stays blue, activists fear the impact of a Trump presidency on the local level. Sean Lim, an organizer based in the Twin Cities, notes that the current climate and housing crisis, as well as the war in Gaza, has been happening under a Democratic administration. However, a Trump presidency comes with its own dangers.

“The danger of a Republican presidency is a right-wing supreme court,” Lim said. “And the court could be coming out with decisions criminalizing homelessness.” Federal rulings could also enable local municipalities to crack down on protesters, he fears.

Rae Rowe, co-founder of the Paper Lantern Project, which advocates for gender and reproductive justice, worries about the access to resources and services for members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, and the impact on their mental health.

“When you consider reproductive justice through a Minnesota lens, we are a trans refugee state, but those rights are being removed from all of our surrounding states,” said Rowe. “And at the same time clinics are losing their funding.” No matter who wins the presidency, Rowe feels it’s urgent to organize.

Red states might also feel emboldened to crack down on trans rights, independent of the outcome of the election, noted Andrea Coleman, one of the members of Twin Cities Trans Mutual Aid. And in Minnesota, there will still be a need after the election to provide financial support to trans people and continue organizing.

Whatever the landscape, activists say they have resilient networks that will allow them to keep pushing for justice and looking out for each other.

Mutual aid is “inherently anti-fascist,” Lim said. “It’s anti-authoritarian, it’s abolitionist, it’s effective, it’s powerful, and it’s beautiful. It allows for us, as neighbors, to come together in the absence of the state doing its job.”"
Minnesota Muslims say they face painful choice at the ballot box,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/minnesota-muslims-vote-presidential-election-2024-harris-trump/,2024-10-31,"Joey Peters, More Joey Peters, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PrimaryVoting2024-8487.jpg,"Months after Muslim voters helped give Minnesota one of the highest “Uncommitted” rates in the Democratic primary, the state’s Muslim community remains sharply split over whom to support in the presidential race.

The fractures have played out in recent weeks with a conflicting series of endorsements by key groups, a heavy-handed effort to get local imams to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, and a survey released by a local nonprofit showing that most Somalis still back Democrats.

The debate has become so heated that many Muslim leaders are reluctant to go on the record supporting any presidential candidate, fearing they will anger some parts of their communities.

Many Muslims say they face a terrible choice at the ballot box, between the Biden administration’s support of Israel’s devastating war in Gaza and former President Donald Trump’s track record of Muslim travel bans and threats to deport millions of immigrants.

“We’re just left between a rock and a hard place,” said Asma Mohammed, a progressive organizer who led the Uncommitted Minnesota campaign earlier this year, which urged voters to reject Biden during the March primary. “Our community is just really easy to come for, and we don’t know where we land right now.”

This is illustrated through diverging endorsements from Muslim-led coalitions across the state. Uncommitted Minnesota, for example, did not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris but also urged voters to reject Trump. Abandon Harris, another Muslim-led organization chaired by University of Minnesota Professor Hassan Abdel Salam that earlier this year formed as Abandon Biden, formally endorsed Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein.

But a recent poll by the nonprofit Bayan Research Center suggests that many Somali Muslims will still end up voting for Harris.

Several Minnesota Muslims also say the atmosphere within the community surrounding this election is more tense than previous elections, and many who spoke with Sahan Journal did not want their names on the record, fearing backlash from their community.

A manufactured endorsement?

A news release circulating earlier this month suggesting that 35 Minnesota imams and Muslim scholars endorsed Harris sparked a backlash from participants.

The release came after three community meetings and included a photo showing the 35 endorsees that was taken at another event. The news was picked up by local community news outlets like Mshale and shared on X by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.

But several who attended the meetings say that the news was misleading, and one of the organizers of the final meeting conceded that not all the imams and scholars who attended the meetings endorsed Harris, but instead said that the majority of them did.

Among those criticizing the news release was Imam Qudbi Dayib of Dar-Us-Salam Center Mosque in Burnsville. Qudbi, who attended the three meetings, said in Facebook post that the meetings “had NOTHING to do with endorsing a candidate” and called the news release “a baseless fabrication designed to advance a weak agenda promoted by those being manipulated by genocide supporters.”

Imam Qudbi declined to comment for this story.

“We have thousands of Falastini and Lebanese families in MN who lost their loved ones in this genocide, millions of people forced out of their homes, under siege for more than a year, deprived of food, water, and basic necessities,” Qudbi wrote. “Hundreds of mothers are giving birth daily under rubbles and in harrowing conditions inconceivable to us. Where is your empathy?! Where is your heart!!”

Several people who participated in the meetings told Sahan Journal that they were not organized to formally endorse a candidate, but instead to provide guidelines about what issues Muslims should weigh before going to the ballot box. One imam, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of community backlash, said the meetings were originally organized to discuss how to keep partisan politics outside of the mosque.

Salman Fiqy, a Republican strategist who attended the first and second meetings, argued that the third meeting was taken over by people aligned with the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, leading to the subsequent endorsement of Harris.

“They have to have some deliverables,” Salman said of the DFL-aligned interests involved in the meeting. “And that was the delivery they needed.”

Imam Abdisalan Adam, a media contact listed on the news release announcing the endorsement, disputed this narrative. He did, however, acknowledge that not everyone involved in the last meeting agreed on an endorsement of Harris.

“It’s understandable,” Imam Abdisalan said. “You don’t expect everybody to be in the same position in a very sensitive and very impactful decision. Two people may be in the same mosque, and one may agree and one may not.”

In the final meeting, attendees were broken up into several small groups, Imam Abdisalan said. Each group then discussed whether to endorse or not endorse Harris. According to one imam who asked to remain anonymous, the question was framed in a reluctant support of the lesser of two evils rather than enthusiastic support of Harris.

“Everyone spoke their mind,” Imam Abdisalan said. “Those who were against were also present, and everyone presented their point of view.”

A majority of the people in each small group voted to endorse Harris, Imam Abdisalan said, leading to the news release.

A part of the backlash, according to Imam Abdisalan, stems from the fact that so many national Muslim organizations are recommending Muslims don’t support Harris or Trump.

“There’s pressure for people to keep in line with that,” he said.

Red, blue or third party?

Speaking for himself, Imam Abdisalan said that he believed Trump would be worse in the war against Gaza, and he pointed to Trump’s travel ban and his promises to institute the largest deportation program in U.S. history as bad for Muslim immigrants. He declined to say how he’s planning to vote.

In his Facebook post, Imam Qudbi made a point that many Minnesota Muslims who spoke to Sahan Journal made: Minnesota will likely vote for Harris anyway with or without their endorsements. Minnesota hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1972 — the longest Democratic Party streak in presidential elections for any state.

“MN will vote blue regardless of your opinion — why tarnish your name in the process?!” he wrote. “Why anger your own community just to appease those who are indifferent to your existence?”

For Mohammed, the likelihood of Harris winning Minnesota is helping her make her decision.

“Because Governor [Tim] Walz is the vice president’s running mate, I think it’s safe to say that the vice president is going to win Minnesota,” Mohammed said.

Because of this and the fact that Harris has not pledged to stop arming Israel, Mohammed, a lifelong Democrat, said she is planning to vote for a third-party candidate for president for the first time in her life.

“I’ve struggled with this because I know that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy,” she said. “Simultaneously, I have friends in Gaza who have had to escape three separate times from the places that they’ve been told to evacuate, and that’s because of U.S. policy.”

Mohammed said she’s supporting down-ballot Democrats and is actively helping Ilhan Omar’s campaign for a fourth term in Congress. She said she has Muslim friends and family members living in Wisconsin, where polls show a close race between Harris and Trump, who are also leaning toward voting third party.

Democrats still dominate

Still, a recent poll of Somalis suggests the majority will back Democrats this year. In a survey released this week by St. Anthony-based Bayan Research Center, 55% of Somalis said they plan to vote for Harris, down from 62% who said they voted for Biden four years ago.

Support for Trump grew 10 percentage points from 2020 to 23% this year. Another 10% said they would vote for a third-party candidate, while 12% said they were undecided.

The online poll, held this fall, had 343 responses; 79% were from Minnesota.

But while the poll shows a doubling of Somali support for the Republican Party in the last four years, support for Democrats still dominates in the community.

For Kenadid Abeiziz, a data analyst with Bayan Research, a few reasons play into this.

“If you look at the [Somali] members who have been elected in the state, all of them came out of the Democratic Party,” he said. “Secondly, the state is a Democratic state, and the Somali community has been here for 30-plus years, and they have grown up within the Democratic Party.”

Still, the survey results point to point to openings in the community for Republicans down the line. The top issue cited by voters was school choice, and the second most important issue was youth and family values.

“Many will tell you that they would like to have schools where kids can learn the Qur’an, or maybe cultural values,” Kenadid said.

This also comes after efforts from local Muslims to opt their kids out of LGBTQ education materials in public schools.

Few Muslims planning to vote who spoke to Sahan Journal for this election expressed enthusiasm for the upcoming election. Mohammed said she wasn’t yet sure which third party candidate she would ultimately vote for for president.

“If anything, that tells you how I feel about this,” she said. “It’s a really hard decision for me. I feel incredibly betrayed by my party, and especially by the top of the ticket.”"
"Minnesota’s Gen Z critical of upcoming elections, but will likely show up to vote",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/gen-z-young-voters-election-2024-minnesota/,2024-10-29,"Binta Kanteh, Elza Goffaux, More Binta Kanteh, More Elza Goffaux, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSC01296.jpg,"Most young people who come to Daniel Solis-Corona tell him that they do not know who to vote for or think they can’t vote because they have been charged with felonies in the past. When he tables with Make Voting a Tradition, a program launched by the Native American Community Development Institute, his role is to help young voters register and to inform people with previous felonies that in Minnesota they have the right to vote.

“I feel that a lot of people who are younger, or around my age, sometimes it is hard to listen to people who are a lot older than you,” said Solis-Corona, 20. “You feel that you don’t relate to them.”

Solis-Corona, who is of Mexican and Native American descent, grew up in the Little Earth community in south Minneapolis and voted for the first time two years ago. He used to think that his vote did not matter, until he discussed this issue with his mother. They now table side by side.

In Minnesota, Gen Z voters, the oldest of whom are 27 this year, are expected to be a crucial voting bloc in this fall’s election. While some are opting out or voting third party because of their frustration with the Democratic and Republican front-runners, the state’s young voters will likely turn out at the polls.

In the 2020 election, 65% of eligible young voters in Minnesota cast a ballot, while the national average only reached 50%. In the 2022 midterms, Minnesota had the third-highest youth voter turnout in the country.

A recent report from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University ranked Minnesota sixth nationally in “youth electoral significance,” meaning Gen Z Minnesotans have the potential to influence the state’s presidential pick, as well as key down-ballot races. Key issues for this group, many organizers say, include reproductive rights, the U.S. involvement in the war on Gaza, climate change and housing.

Mannie Bioh is the co-founder of Believe in What’s Possible (BIWP), a youth-led nonpartisan nonprofit working to increase voter participation among the youngest Minnesota voters. Through their youth engagement, Bioh has learned more about why youth feel disillusioned with the upcoming elections in November.

“When it comes to issues like systemic violence such as police brutality, climate change, international relations such as the genocide happening in different places like Gaza and the Congo — I think it is creating somewhat of a hardship and a frustration within young people to see how various politicians locally and nationally are addressing the issues,” said Bioh.

As a part of their role, Bioh goes to places around the Twin Cities with high attendance of Gen Zers and talks to them about what makes those spaces special and meaningful, then aims to recreate those spaces in a political context. In August, BIWP organized a “Do it for the Ballot” Day Party three days ahead of the primary elections with local DJs, games, food and free transportation to polling locations.

‘A lot of anxiety’

In Minnesota, more than half a million Gen Zers are registered to vote. Last Tuesday, the University of Minnesota held a pop-up voting site for the first time, after a 2023 law allowed on campus early voting sites.

Mi Gente Latinx Center at the University of Minnesota organized a phone bank and called voters to encourage them to cast their ballot. Gabriel Granillo, co-president of the organization, votes in his home state in Arizona. He is engaged in the upcoming election because he is concerned about how the 47th president could potentially shape future Supreme Court rulings.

“We have a really conservative SCOTUS right now and I think Roe v. Wade getting overturned that easily is really scary for other landmark cases,” he said. He is afraid that Obergefell v. Hodges could also be overturned, opening the door for some states to ban on same-sex marriage. As a gay man himself, he hopes to get married in the future. Granillo added that access to reproductive care and decreasing the cost of college are high-stakes issues for him.

Emiliano Rosales Ramirez, co-cultural director of Mi Gente, cannot vote due to his status as a lawful permanent resident, but is anxious when it comes to the elections. “For most people looking into America, it seems like the election should be clear-cut, right?” he said, referring to former President Donald Trump’s felonies.“But the race is actually very, very divided, and it’s hard to know the outcome. So there’s a lot of anxiety going on right now and a bit of fear.”

The pool of young voters is more racially diverse than other generations, bringing forward different issues. Unidos MN has launched a program to reach out to young Latino voters, in southwest metro suburbs.

To Veva Garcia, who organizes this outreach, educating young people on how to vote is a way for the community to be heard since they are more likely to be U.S. citizens than their elders.

“They are the voice of their parents, parents who work and bring a lot to this nation,” Garcia said. “Thus, I can tell with certainty that the Latino vote will be an important part in this election.”

Neither party fits

The only time Sydney Ockenga felt good during this presidential campaign was when they voted “Uncommitted” during the primaries. Their choice between the two main candidates is not clear-cut.

“I feel like no matter where my vote goes, it’ll have to be towards whoever I see is the less evil,” said Ockenga, 26. “Is it going to make me sleep at night better? Probably not.”

Originally from the Flandreau Santee Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota, Ockenga lives, works and votes in Minnesota. To Ockenga, the Democratic Party shows the Republicans as the worst evil.

“That just feels like a kind of a backhanded thing to try to convince us all to vote for them, even though they’re not offering us anything,” said Ockenga, who would like to see candidates address and act on housing, student loans, and the U.S. involvement in Gaza.

“I think it is a big blunder to not pay attention to young people and their demands,” said Twin Cities organizer Sean Lim. “What you are seeing is young people peeling away from the Democratic Party,” he added.

The Republican party is also losing support among some younger voters. Solis-Corona likes Trump’s message on the economy and would have voted for him if not for his criminal record.

“I’m not going to lie, I’m liking everything he’s talking about,” said Solis-Corona. “But I would not feel right with myself putting my vote for him.”

A painful choice

“I just don’t want to deal with any of them,” said University of Minnesota computer science student Hanad Ali, 22. Ali said when he was growing up, his family leaned Democratic because of promises made to support new immigrants. Ali is changing that voting tradition this year. “I don’t feel comfortable voting for two people who are both complicit in a genocide that’s going on,” Ali said. “Both of them defend Israel, and both of them try to make an excuse.”

Kowsar Hirsi, a second-year student at Minneapolis College is also sitting out this election because of U.S. funding to Israel. “I don’t stand for genocide. And I don’t think I want to vote because I feel like whatever decision I make, whoever I vote for is going to contribute to that,” she said.

Hirsi said she would like to see viable third parties that could compete with the Democratic and Republican parties and give voters a true choice.

“I just wish that there was a lot more options,” she said.

“I think a lot of people are really beginning to question if a party system works in the ways that it showcases their beliefs and what they want for their future,” Bioh said.

That is one reason Lim is more excited about local than federal races. “I think that policies are most impactful on people’s standard of living the more local you get,” he said, pointing to Minneapolis school board races as one example.

With his experience engaging in various forms of political action, Lim knows that voting is not the only tool in the hands of the Gen Z.

“We have lobbying, mutual aid, direct action,” he said. “And I think that voting only gets us so far, it needs to be a combination of these tools that actually wins us the city that we deserve.”"
University of Minnesota students call for release of pro-Palestinian protesters arrested for occupying campus building,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/university-of-minnesota-palestine-protesters-arrested-israel-divestment/,2024-10-22,"Katelyn Vue, Becky Z.

The University of Minnesota’s Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) started a protest Monday afternoon with students barricading themselves inside Morrill Hall and refusing to leave. The group’s tactics were meant to pressure the university into meeting their divestment demands.

Juliet Murphy, a University student and SDS member, said at Tuesday’s news conference that the group is demanding that the university cut all ties with Israel and weapon manufacturing companies because of the war in Gaza. Divestment includes no longer investing in those companies and halting study abroad programs in Israel, she said.

University of Minnesota police and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Department arrested the protesters around 5 p.m. at Morrill Hall. SDS said the demonstrators are facing riot, trespassing and damage to property charges; one arrestee is facing a fourth-degree assault charge.

All of the arrestees were being held at the Hennepin County jail without bail as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. The university said eight were current students and three were former students.

SDS member Sasmit Rahman said the organization is working to obtain legal representation for everyone who was arrested.

Rahman said police officers were “aggressive” in arresting demonstrators, and pushed protesters out of the building Monday evening. Murphy and Rahman said the police presence at the protest was “significant.” There were about 50 squad cars parked outside Morrill Hall, Murphy said.

“I know they came in with riot gear, with their batons,” Rahman said. “I think there absolutely was the intent to seriously hurt our protesters if they didn’t comply.”

University President Rebecca Cunningham sent an email to the campus community Tuesday morning, saying that Monday’s protest had “crossed the line into illegal activity.”

“We have seen many peaceful protests this fall,” she wrote. “However, what happened in Morrill Hall yesterday was not a form of legitimate protest.”

Cunningham said protesters spray-painted security cameras so they would not work, broke interior windows and barricaded doors. University staff were inside Morrill Hall at the time of the occupation, she said, and some were unable to leave “for an extended period of time” because students had barricaded doors with furniture and bicycle locks.

“This was a terrifying experience for many of our employees,” she said.

The Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Minnesota and the Dakotas issued a statement Wednesday praising Cunningham’s response to the protests, and described the activists who occupied the building as “pro-Hamas demonstrators.”

The JCRC said that over the past year, it had warned about “violent rhetoric” from University of Minnesota student groups that used statements “calling for the murder of Jews,” such as “Glory to the Resistance,” “Globalize the Intifada,” or “Victory to Al Aqsa Flood.” These statements had “disrupted campus life not just for our Jewish students, but the vast majority of U of M students who do not share these activists’ pro-Hamas beliefs,” the council said.

“We have long feared that such violent rhetoric would escalate into actual violence,” said the JCRC statement. “Sadly, our worst fears were realized this Monday with the violent takeover of Morrill Hall.”

Cunningham said the extent of property damage was not yet known, and that Morrill Hall would be closed Tuesday and Wednesday so the university could assess damages and make repairs.

“It [property damage] wasn’t done just to destroy things,” Murphy said at the news conference. “It was done to protect students.”

University employees in Morrill Hall were repeatedly informed by protesters that they could leave the building and were offered student escorts, Rahman said. Several people were escorted out, she added.

“The small group of people who chose to remain in and bunker down, and lock themselves in for as long as possible, made that choice for themselves,” Rahman said. “There was never any threat.”

Late Tuesday afternoon, another group, Students for Justice in Palestine, held a rally on campus. About 100 students marched from Coffman Memorial Union toward Morrill Hall, holding banners and playing drums.

SJP member and biology student Ali Abu said the goal of the rally was to “keep the pressure” and show support for those arrested Monday.

“As Palestinian students, we don’t get what we want unless we escalate,” he said.

With its long history as a site of student protests, Morrill Hall was the most symbolic place for Monday’s action, SDS members said. During the takeover, they renamed it “Halimy Hall” in honor of Mohammad “Medo” Halimy, a Palestinian vlogger who was killed in August during an Israeli airstrike on Gaza.

“In Lebanon and Palestine, the images are horrific,” Murphy said. “It’s an urgent situation and the administration is not acting urgently.”

University officials closed Northrop auditorium on Tuesday and rescheduled a talk by Dr. Anthony Fauci, citing the “complicated” situation on campus.

Students escalate tactics

Monday night’s occupation marked an escalation of recent student protest tactics, after what looked like a peaceful resolution to an encampment in the spring.

In April, nine people, mostly students, were arrested at the university for setting up an encampment in support of Palestinians. After those arrests, another student encampment lasted for nearly 10 days. Students took down the tents when then-Interim University President Jeff Ettinger agreed to consider the protesters’ demands, which included divesting the university endowment from Israel and weapons manufacturers.

But in June, Ettinger reversed a decision to hire the Israeli historian Raz Segal as director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, following pushback from the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas. Segal had described Israel’s military actions in Gaza as “genocide.”

After Ettinger withdrew the offer to Segal, the Faculty Senate held a no-confidence vote in both Ettinger and Provost Rachel Croson.

The University of Minnesota Board of Regents voted in August not to divest from Israel. Instead, the regents adopted a “position of neutrality” regarding the endowment and said they would consider future divestment requests in rare circumstances where “broad consensus” existed in the university community.

During that same meeting, the university’s new president, Rebecca Cunningham, laid out a set of policies that she said would guide the university’s approach to protests this year. Those included limiting protests to 100 people, unless they requested a permit in advance; a maximum of one megaphone per protest; and restrictions on protest sign size.

The guidelines also specified prohibited protest activities, including damaging university property and blocking building entrances. The policies outlined a tiered system of university response to protest, from educational warnings to arrest.

During Cunningham’s inauguration in September, a group of student protesters interrupted her remarks, shouting, “You are all complicit with the Israeli genocide in Gaza!”

Students, joined by about a dozen professors, recited a list of demands, including divestments. The protesting faculty wore shirts that said “Respect the no-confidence vote.” University officials said the interruption lasted four minutes before protesters left on their own, and no formal disciplinary action was imposed on students or staff."

The district is starting its process of “school transformation,” which could include closures and consolidations. At the same time, more than 2,500 new immigrant students have enrolled in Minneapolis Public Schools, stabilizing the district’s enrollment for the first time in years. Those new students could lead to increased state funding — but also increased costs, because the state does not fully fund English language services. The end of COVID relief funding meant significant budget cuts last year, and the district is expected to cut more this spring. School officials hope that voters will approve a technology levy this fall, which would provide more funds but not prevent budget cuts altogether.

These big decisions will be made by the nine-member Minneapolis school board. Next year’s school board will include at least two new members. Ira Jourdain, who represents District 6 in southwest Minneapolis, is stepping down. Early childhood educator Lara Bergman and former teachers union president Greta Callahan are vying for that open seat. (The school board is also in the process of filling a vacancy in District 3 in south Minneapolis, after Faheema Feerayarre resigned, but that seat won’t be on this year’s ballot. Existing school board members will make a temporary appointment until voters choose a representative in 2026.)

And all Minneapolis voters will have the opportunity to vote on an at-large school board seat. Incumbent Kim Ellison and accountant Shayla Owodunni are running for that seat.

Incumbents Sharon El-Amin, who represents District 2 in north Minneapolis, and Adriana Cerrillo, who represents District 4, including downtown and parts of south Minneapolis, are running unopposed for reelection.

Name: Kim Ellison Age: 60 Day job: Administrative assistant to a chief operating officer at a nonprofit; incumbent school board member. Kids in district: Parent of four adult children who attended Minneapolis Public Schools.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why are you running for reelection to the Minneapolis school board?

I’m running for reelection because I’m still super excited about the work, especially with the new superintendent and a very young board, and I’m just still hopeful about the work we can do together creating opportunities for students in the city.

What do you love about Minneapolis Public Schools?

What I love are the people: our families, our staff, the students, of course. What I’m excited about is how the people can all come together with this one mission of providing quality education for children.

Minneapolis Public Schools enacted painful budget cuts last year when COVID relief funding expired, and is expected to cut more this year. How do you think the school district should approach budget cuts when they’re necessary, and what do you think needs to happen to shore up district finances so cuts are not necessary in the future?

The board members and community need to be advocating for adequate funding for public schools. One of the boards I sat on before I was on the school board was Parents United for Public Schools, where for a number of years, I looked at how public schools throughout the state are underfunded, especially for our new arrivals, languages, our special ed and then the health services that we need to provide for students, mental health specifically.

So we need to be advocating that schools are fully funded and that our federal and state government fulfill their promises, especially around special ed and funding services that we provide for students. We need to look at enrollment. Why do students leave? What could bring families back? That would help.

My children all went to Minneapolis Public Schools when the district had about 50,000 students attending the district. We still have that same footprint in terms of staff and buildings and services that we provide, and we’re serving 29,000 students. So we need to do some right-sizing without compromising the quality of the work that we provide.

I don’t know if we need to close schools. Closing a building — and I differentiate between schools and buildings — closing a building does not save that much money. I mean, you’ve got electricity, water, utilities. But I do believe we should be consolidating programs, and that might not mean we’re cutting. In some cases, because enrollment is so small, then maybe we need to be cutting back on some of the programs.

But our only growing demographic right now are Spanish-speaking students. One thing that parents have said over and over again, and we have wait-lists for, is our Spanish immersion dual language programs. IB [International Baccalaureate] is very popular. We might need to be looking at how we can expand, also, some of the programs that are popular. And that’s what transformation means to me: giving families what they’re looking for.

Can you tell me a little bit more about the distinction you’re drawing between closing buildings and consolidating programs? What does consolidation look like that’s not closing a building?

It might be closing. But we have a couple programs where we have lower schools and upper schools. It’s all elementary. So maybe we need to consolidate those programs so they’re all under one building. They’re already under one theme. But we haven’t really lost anything. We’re still serving kindergarten through fifth grade. We’re just doing it in one place.

When we talk about closing buildings, I don’t want people to think that they’re going to be losing anything, which is why I make that distinction between schools, programs and buildings.

What are the most important steps you think the district can take to reverse enrollment declines?

I think they should be talking to parents. What would keep parents here? Why did parents leave? When I say parents, I mean whole families. To stop enrollment decline, again, what is it that families need? What do the students need? And then make sure that we’re able to offer that.

I do believe we need to work with our city parks, the city and the county. When we started losing enrollment a few years ago, they were leaving the city because they didn’t feel safe. We can’t solve for all of the ills that families are feeling, but we can partner with some of our elected officials, the city level, the state level and the county level, to ensure that even outside of school, families are feeling supported.

There’s a growing demand in the district for language and cultural programs. How do you think the district should respond to those demands in a time of financial strain?

We talk about how we need to be creating citizens who are prepared to operate in this world that they live in, and so we should be offering it, and that’s what families want, and it’s important. We know it’s important. I understand it might be spendy, but if that’s what keeps families in the district, brings families back, then it seems like a win-win situation.

How do you think Minneapolis Public Schools can support and retain new immigrant families?

I think we have a lot of that already going on. We’ve got our Somali pathway. We’ve got Hmong language and culture being taught in our schools, the same with Spanish. I think one thing that we don’t do well is advertising that. We’re not talking to families as they come in, new to country, new to the state, and letting them know that it’s available.

What are you proud of from your service on the school board?

Ethnic studies. It was a lot of work to get that even offered as an option, and now one semester is a requirement for graduation. That’s what I’m most proud of.

What’s another school board priority of yours we haven’t talked about?

Out-of-school time. What is our community ed department doing? School ends before work ends for families. So what are we doing to bridge that gap so students don’t get lost after they finish with school? What’s happening after school that we can support?"

Kids in the district: None. Has been volunteering at Pillsbury Elementary School through Early Learning Corps since last school year.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why are you running for Minneapolis school board?

Through my experience at Pillsbury, my eyes were opened to how incredible our teachers and our students are. It was around April when I started to plug into learning about the school board. The teacher whose classroom I was volunteering in wasn’t sure if she was going to have a position in the coming year, and the associate educator was deciding that she wasn’t going to pursue teaching anymore. With my internal auditor hat, I was like, “Okay, why don’t we have the budget for this? And who does make these decisions?”

Also, looking at the statistics around our children, primarily our students of color. I was essentially a volunteer interventionist, and it really opened my eyes. A lot of parents would opt out of interventions because they would say things like “My child doesn’t need an intervention.” I was like, “Oh, the wording of these things, it’s very confusing. How do we make the learning fun?”

I was looking at the winter assessment data and seeing how there was a decline and how only 44% of our children are reading at grade level as of the winter assessments, and then only 39% were proficient in math. Being from an immigrant household, I know the doors that having those literacy skills and math open, whether you want to go to college or not.

So from seeing the experiences in the classroom, and then also having a government accounting and internal audit and compliance background, I was like, you know what, my skill set is uniquely positioned to be able to help out with the district.

What do you love about Minneapolis Public Schools?

I love the people. I’m very much driven [by] community, and I am very excited about all of the potential that is within MPS. I was working with children at the beginning of the year who were unable to count to 10. Some were unable to count to three. Really being able to personalize what works for them, and seeing that spark when they were excited and understood.

For some of the students, who were unable to count to three, the initial practice that we were doing during our groups, wasn’t working. So then I started asking, what do you want to be when you grow up? [One said] she wanted to be Ice Spice. She likes her outfits. So I was like, well, you’ll need money to be able to have that. Money drives me as an adult, that drives a lot of people.

So I got some school dollars off Amazon and some wallets, and my mom used her Cricut and put their names on it. Instead of calling it interventions or assessments, I just called it, we’re math masters. So then all of the children became so excited to be math masters. Some of them were calling themselves superduper math masters. Just by using these dollars, they were able to learn counting.

By the end of the year, we had some of our 5-year-olds doing multiplication and looking forward to groups and telling their parents about it. Just seeing the energy that is possible when children are excited to come to school, and learning and understanding. Even when we’d have playtime, they would say, no, we want to play math games.

So that’s what has me excited about MPS. I would love to be able to be that voice to connect all community members around Minneapolis Public Schools.

Minneapolis Public Schools enacted painful budget cuts last year when COVID relief funding expired, and is expected to cut more this year. How do you think the school district should approach budget cuts when they’re necessary? What do you think needs to happen to shore up district finances so cuts are not necessary in the future?

One thing I would like to look at is a zero-based budgeting standpoint. Really analyzing what is a direct impact to our students. I feel like that would allow for more transparency and clarity of, are there areas where we can trim or pause or reconsider?

I feel like adding that layer of clarity and transparency around the budget, where everyone is very clear and understanding around why we’re doing what we’re doing and in what order, I think that allows for better projections long-term as well. Especially now that we’re approaching statutory operating debt, it is definitely something that we need to take a new approach on.

What I hope comes out of the transformation process is, again, community engagement and transparency around what happens next.

When you look at the potential for school closures, that is a very sensitive topic on all sides. I would love to get on looking at the budget of what is in the best interest of our students and our families, to have that conversation of really analyzing the budget and knowing, what numbers do we need to hit? What schools?

I have talked to parents where they’re saying there’s either large class sizes, or where there’s only one fifth-grade class. I’ve heard the wide spectrum of this. If we close, I would like to see projections: What does it look like if we don’t close any? If we close two, what does that look like?

I think it is taking a more pragmatic approach and being thoughtful about what is the impact to our families, especially when we look at the number of families leaving the district as well. That is something that I wouldn’t take lightly.

What are the most important steps you think the district can take to reverse enrollment declines?

Looking into what were the key reasons that families are leaving or considering leaving. Being very clear on what are the top reasons that our families are leaving the district, and then coming up with a remediation plan to address those needs, so we’re not still facing the same issues two years from now or five years from now.

Ultimately, what I’ve heard from all parents is that they want the best for their children, and so that’s really my goal in running: to make MPS a destination that families want to stay in and also that families want to come to.

There’s a growing demand in the district for language and cultural programs. How do you think the district should respond to those demands in a time of financial strain?

Look at our curriculum around how that would be incorporated. I know it’s something, when teachers already have a full load in their day, of having the time to thoughtfully implement new support, new curriculum.

And I think it is having that conversation about what is collaborative and a best practice to incorporate those learnings, which ultimately, I feel would benefit all students when what they’re learning every day is relatable and able to be understood. In my class this year, the teacher I’m working with and I are taking a Spanish for educators course, because we do have a growing population of Spanish-only speaking students.

So to think creatively how we address those needs so that students are able to feel supported when they come to school, while also finding that balance of teacher development and support as well to make that available.

How do you think Minneapolis Public Schools can support and retain new immigrant families?

The biggest thing is for parents to feel that they are a part of their child’s educational journey with resources and support. For example, last year, we had families who had newly immigrated. By just having conversations with them about what we were working on in the classroom, and then providing tools and resources where they could continue that journey at home, it really was a partnership.

I feel like that is one of the pivotal points for families: to feel that they are in partnership in a way that is relevant to them and their community. If a parent has newly come, their first thought isn’t, let me join a PTA group. How can we look at culturally relevant organizations and happenings within Minneapolis, and be able to get them connected to community that also pours into Minneapolis Public Schools?

What’s another school board priority of yours we haven’t talked about?

I would love to look into authentic assessments. As we look at the pillar around academics, to really take a look at how we are around academic achievement, is how we are assessing our students in a way that is authentic and actually representative of what they are going to experience in the real world."

Name: Lara Bergman Age: 39 Day job: Early childhood educator who has worked primarily in Montessori early childhood centers, where she is currently substitute teaching while campaigning. Kids in the district: Two at Armatage Elementary.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why do you want to be on the Minneapolis school board?

I’m an MPS alum myself, graduated from South High in 2003, and really feel like the experience I had as a student was foundational to who I am as an adult. I want to be able to pay that back and pay it forward.

I know that the disparities in our district between students of color and our white students continue to persist. It was true when I was a student in MPS, and here we are 20+ years later, and they still exist. As an educator, I feel very called to do what I can to address that, because we need to make sure that our schools are equipping our students to have what they need to be successful as they go out into the world.

My two kids are elementary age. We’re going to be some of the people that are impacted by the decisions that the board is making. One thing I’ve heard a lot campaigning, is that parents don’t feel trusted and listened to by our district leaders. One of the big things that really made me want to jump in was that we need to be listening to our community.

We need to be rebuilding trust. I’m very confident that I can bring that independent voice that listens to all stakeholders, including parents and their real concerns about if their kids’ needs are being met. Really hoping to change that culture in our district around how we engage with community and how we’re actually listening and looking for ways to build bridges and partner with families.

I want to treat it as a full-time job. I’m in the position where I’m able to do that. Unfortunately, it isn’t paid enough, and a lot of folks do have to work a whole other full-time job. But I just want to want to be able to be out in the schools, listening to educators, listening to principals, doing my due diligence and make sure that I’m getting all the information, reviewing everything, to have the time to do deep dives to get the information that I need to do the job well.

What do you love about Minneapolis Public Schools?

I love the fact that we are such an incredibly diverse district. As an inner-city school district, we see not just racial diversity and ethnic diversity, but linguistic diversity, socioeconomic diversity. We have so many children of differing abilities, and I really think that that is our strength as a district, and one of the things that presents a lot of challenges, because we have such diverse needs across our district.

So finding ways to bring our community together around a central identity of this is who we are as Minneapolis Public Schools, this is what we value. We value our diversity. We value that we can and should be the place where every child feels like they can be seen and fully served. I’m very hopeful about our potential as a district, to not just have the diversity, but say that we are serving all kids well.

Minneapolis Public Schools enacted painful budget cuts last year when COVID relief funding expired, and is expected to cut more this year. How do you think the school district should approach budget cuts when they’re necessary? What do you think needs to happen to shore up district finances so cuts are not necessary in the future?

Bringing the community into those conversations, not just as we’re going through the budget cycle, but consistently communicating with the community about how we got to this moment. What we saw during the teachers strike was, a lot of folks didn’t even really understand how our district got its money and weren’t aware of the big gaps in funding from the state for our special education and English language learner services.

And so I think just explaining we aren’t having these mandates funded fully from the state and federal government, and that’s one of the reasons that we’re in this moment.

I think another thing is just telling folks that we have seen a decline in enrollment, and it’s been for a variety of reasons. It’s been everything from families leaving the district because their kids aren’t getting the support they need to learn to read, to the pandemic when we were online for a year and families needed to get their kids into school.

There’s just a whole bunch of reasons that our enrollment has declined, including incoming kindergarten projections for the fact that we just don’t have as many young children living in the city because families are choosing to live outside of Minneapolis. So just being really honest and transparent about how we got to this moment financially.

But then I think the thing that we need to do as a board, and one of the things I’ve been running on, is financial sustainability. I look across our district right now, and we may have a balanced budget, but we don’t have a thriving system.

We have schools that have huge class sizes and also we’re cutting programs that families are looking for, whether it’s advanced coursework or arts programming or full-time specialists in buildings. In order to get to a sustainable and thriving system, I think that the board needs to have a really solid plan about how we are going to be smarter with the resources we have, by consolidating and possibly closing some buildings.

One thing that I’ve been saying is we can’t be more concerned about saving buildings than we are about what is happening inside those buildings. And right now, what’s happening inside those buildings isn’t attractive to a lot of families. We have to demonstrate as a board that we are passing budgets that are making those tough decisions, but at the end of the day, they are going to be centering students and getting students what they need to thrive.



I think that a critical piece of school transformation needs to really be this authentic community engagement: make sure that we are listening to the community and what they’re needing to see from our schools.

And I think there are opportunities to expand some of the things. We have a lot of families that would like to be in Spanish dual-language programs, but we don’t have the spots for them. So I think expanding our dual-language programming into more buildings could be a way to really make that investment and draw families to Minneapolis Public School as part of our transformation.

Taking a look at early childhood: right now, MPS does offer some early childhood programming, but we could definitely expand it, not only as a strategic means to address our disparities in students, because the research shows the importance of early childhood to address that later on in school, but also it’s an enrollment strategy.

I really think there’s this need in the community — families would love to have more opportunities to engage with our public school district at an earlier age, especially if their older children are already in our buildings. That measure of convenience is something that is really attractive to families.

If the board determines that both for student experiences and outcomes and financial sustainability that we need to close and consolidate schools, what could we be doing with some of these buildings? Could we start imagining and dreaming and planning and reaching out to the necessary partners at every level of government, and community partners too, to talk about, how could these buildings be not just left vacant, but they’re a value-add to our communities?

Could they be early childhood service hubs? Could they be affordable housing? Could they be other sorts of community service centers? This conversation around transformation presents an opportunity to start really dreaming and imagining how we could utilize these buildings differently in a way that would again center the needs of our students and our community.

What are the most important steps you think the district can take to reverse enrollment declines?

We have to have the robust programs in our buildings that families are looking for. We’ve lost a lot of families in District 6 here to Edina and Bloomington schools. They’re leaving for schools that have 500 kids in an elementary school, and therefore are able to support those robust programming and the smaller class sizes, and the one-to-one support by having more ESPs [educational support professionals] and assistant educators to assist when a child has individualized needs.

We have so many schools in our district that aren’t able to provide those things, because there simply aren’t enough children in a building to bring in that revenue. Principals are forced to make these cuts. But anecdotally, we know that it’s not a thriving system for students or educators. I think making sure that the buildings that we do have, have all the robust programming that is going to make families choose MPS.

Secondly, the fact that so many of our kids in Minneapolis Public Schools aren’t reading at grade level, I think, is a big deterrent for folks looking to choose our schools. They want to know that when they send their kids to schools, they’re getting what they need, and that means a really solid foundation in literacy.

As an early childhood educator, I’m a big proponent of making sure that we have evidence-based curriculum and that we have teachers that are trained to implement it. With the READ Act, the Legislature is going to be requiring this of districts, but we need to make sure as a board that we’re following through and that we’re constantly monitoring those literacy rates, because I think that’s another thing that is going to drive families either to or from this district.

And then finally, early childhood. I think looking for ways to provide the programming that families need and are looking for is a really good enrollment strategy.

There’s a growing demand in the district for language and culture programs. How do you think the district should respond to those demands in a time of financial strain?

Again, I think that the school transformation is an opportunity to really lean in and listen to those communities. We’ve seen it across the river in St. Paul when they created their Somali culture program, and now with the expansion of their Karen language programming. Those are programs that those communities were asking for, and when St. Paul Public Schools responded, it brought families to the district, instead of leaving for some of those culturally responsive charter programs that we hear about.

So I think there is a real opportunity to listen to the community and meet those needs. As I mentioned, we have an incredibly diverse district, and we need to make sure that our schools are reflective of that.

How do you think Minneapolis Public Schools can support and retain new immigrant families?

We know that city centers like Minneapolis are usually the first stop for those immigrant families. Whether it’s them just coming and finding their place and then settling in, or using it as kind of a pass-through, it is my firm belief that it’s our responsibility to meet the needs of every child that walks in our doors.

So we absolutely need to be advocating to the Legislature to fully fund our English language learner services mandate, because we do have such a high population of those immigrant families coming that need that support. We also can really invest in our teachers that are able to culturally and linguistically meet those families where they’re at.

I think that sense of belonging, especially when immigrant families have been through traumatic months to get here. They want to be able to send their kids to a school where they feel like they’re going to be safe, they’re going to be taken care of, and that they’re going to be given those opportunities, and being met with folks that reflect their language and culture, I think, is a big part of that.

What’s another school board priority of yours we haven’t talked about?

Another priority for me that’s really personal is making sure that our LGBTQIA students and staff and families are safe and supported in our schools. I have two queer kids, and was part of the group of parents pushing for the gender inclusion policy last spring, which the board did adopt, but we haven’t seen implementation of that.

So we have to make sure that we don’t just pass policies, but that we really need to be accountable, whether it’s gender inclusion or our budget or literacy rates. We have to be able to make sure we have measures of accountability that these policies and budgets are having the intended impact, because otherwise it doesn’t change the experiences of students and educators in our schools."

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why do you want to be on the Minneapolis school board?

I desperately want our public schools to thrive in Minneapolis, and that’s because I believe they are the bedrock of democracy. I am watching public schools get dismantled across the country and in our city. And when this seat opened up, I felt like it was my duty as a citizen with the knowledge and experience and qualifications I have to run for this seat.

What do you love about Minneapolis Public Schools?

Oh, gosh, everything. I grew up attending Minneapolis Public Schools. I love our little community schools. I love the people who are in them. I love the dedication that you see teachers and families have. The students obviously are literally always the best part. But I think we just have something so special, and I just don’t want to see it go away.

Minneapolis Public Schools enacted painful budget cuts last year when COVID relief funding expired, and is expected to cut more this year. How do you think the school district should approach budget cuts when they’re necessary? What do you think needs to happen to shore up district finances so cuts are not necessary in the future?

I want to start off by saying that all the school boards across the country and all of the national, state, and local unions should be banding together about this money going away, and I have not heard much about it. This was critical funding that, quite frankly, just filled holes we already had. I just don’t even know what is going on in the world, that we’re just continuing to accept the defunding of public education.

We know that there are mandates around Title I, ELL [English language learners], special ed that are not funded. That’s another thing that all of us should be getting on board about.

The more I’m knocking doors and talking about the budget and talking about funds, the more upset I am at our state and federal government for not only not funding these mandates, but for, quite frankly, abdicating their responsibility around integration and around taking care of humans and leaving it up to the schools to try to fix all of these problems.

I’m definitely focused on this larger problem, instead of fighting amongst ourselves for what we have. And I know that we have to get a plan right now to retain the families we have.

We have a lot of families hanging by a thread here in the Minneapolis Public Schools, and we need to co-create with them, and we’ll get guaranteed programming that they want that’s going to keep them, and simultaneously be working on a plan for increasing enrollment and expansion. These are all critical necessary things that we need to be working on collectively.

I think that before we are ever letting words fly out of our mouth around “transformation,” or closing schools, we need to ask three questions. Number one, how much money are we going to save from closing a particular school? Number two, how many of those students do we believe we will retain if we close that school, and how did we get to that number? Number three, how many students have to enroll in that school to keep it open?

It’s a very pragmatic approach. It’s something every single leader should be asking before letting any other words fly out of their mouths, because that’s only leading to a further enrollment decline and distrust in this district.

We know that we’ve done school closures before and we’ve said the words “right-sizing this district” before, and it’s only led us to more cuts and more closures, and we’re in a place right now where 42% of eligible MPS kids aren’t attending MPS, and that number is going to grow if we continue on this path of austerity: cutting, firing, closing, cutting, firing, closing. That’s a vicious cycle.

We also do need, and luckily have, some legislators right now working on our wild open enrollment laws. When kids can go to any public school system, and they can advertise to our families here in Minneapolis, that is dangerous. That is the defunding and dismantling of Minneapolis Public Schools. So there’s a lot of big things we need to work on, but no way is it impossible.

And by the way, we should be doing literally every single thing we can to keep our little community schools open. This is why people move to some of these neighborhoods. I am going to fight like hell to keep our schools open and to have a thriving Minneapolis public school system, and right-sizing our district would actually be getting those 42% of kids into our schools. That’s the size that our district is built for, and those are the kids in our city.

What are the most important steps you think the district can take to reverse enrollment declines?

First of all, stabilize. Stop trying to find the shiny new object. Stabilize this district. Do deep work in our schools. This is what I did in my union leadership: empower people at the site level to be helping do some of this co-creation and deep work that we need around what is going to keep people.

I have knocked countless doors and the widely, deeply felt issues here are class sizes, getting individualized attention for our students, things like world languages and music and the arts, and librarians and High Five.

Some of this could be guaranteed programming, so that people know, yes, schools can have some autonomy, but they know that if you go to the Minneapolis Public Schools, you have a librarian. If you go to the Minneapolis Public Schools, you’re going to get fifth-grade band and orchestra. And by the way, they want fourth-grade band and orchestra.

But looking at some of these things that are going to stabilize the district and keep people is critical if we want to grow. Because those families saying, “Nope, my school feels great,” “No, our class sizes are okay” — those things are what brings in more people.

There’s a growing demand in the district for language and cultural programs. How do you think the district should respond to those demands in a time of financial strain?

If that is a widely, deeply felt issue that families want, then we should do everything we can to ensure that we have it, because that is how we’re going to retain, stabilize and grow, and that means more funding.

How do you think Minneapolis Public Schools can support and retain new immigrant families?

The support is critical. We have to be supporting our buildings and educators in order to support those families and those students, because last year, nothing was done. We had teachers from every side of the city finding ways to provide curriculum for the new-to-country students on their caseload or in their classrooms.

We have teachers who taught art but happened to speak Spanish, so suddenly they were filling in for interpretation for most classrooms. I have seen the increase in interpreters and different curriculum we have purchased in the last school board meeting, and I’m so glad to hear that and see that.

But we need to ensure that at the site level, these students are getting the supports they need. Of course, that comes down to hiring more diverse educators and people who can communicate with our students and looking at the different needs of different sites, because there are different amounts of new-to-country students at different schools and ensuring that those with higher needs are receiving the supports they deserve.

At the end of the day, we cannot have this outstanding district without outstanding support. Last year, talking to teachers at South, at Anthony, at Andersen, one thing was clear: There was no direction from the district, there was no direction from the state on how to best serve these students, and everyone was winging it.

That is not a quality education system, and that is not meeting our students where they’re at. We need MPS to be supporting this, but we need our state to be stepping in and offering more supports as well.

What’s another school board priority of yours we haven’t talked about?

I’m trying to save MPS. I’m trying to make sure that we have strong public schools, and that means having public schools at all. We are at threat of losing the Minneapolis Public Schools if we continue doing what we’ve been doing and not calling on government to do their part.

I am just so rooted in a thriving public school system. Having smarter critical thinkers, which is what a public school system provides, and having students be around other students, and learning how to work with humans who may not look or sound like you, these are all things that make an adult healthy and functioning and more peaceful.

And if we continue on this path, we will just have more of the haves and the have-nots. We will continue to have gaps in pay, in education, the word gap, name all the gaps, they will only continue to grow if we don’t get a handle on this and have a thriving public school system, not just here, but around the country. There is so much at threat, and also so much good that can happen if this is the turning point in a positive direction.

This open seat represents two choices. Which direction are we going to go in: status quo, already given up, cut, fire, close? Or are we going to choose to invest in our public schools and educate the public about why this is critical, and call on government to do their job and band together for the good of this city? I choose the latter."

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why are you running for reelection to the Minneapolis school board?

Because we must continue the great work that we are doing. Because representation matters. Because my community is asking me to continue being in this position so that we can continue to dive deeper into what needs to be done, and I am the person to do it. I’m not afraid of speaking the truth and holding each other accountable. So that we can deliver together for our kids.

What do you love about Minneapolis Public Schools?

More than anything, it’s our kids, it’s our children, it’s our youth. What’s not to love about them, right? Our staff. Not all of our staff. [laughter] Did she say that? Yes, I did. Some of our staff, let me rephrase that. The superintendent. The board, as well, even though it’s very challenging times.

Currently working a lot with the Minneapolis delegation, state representatives and state senators, and also with the county board and the [City] Council of Minneapolis, with new MFT [Minneapolis Federation of Teachers] leadership, also the ESPs [education support professionals].

We know the challenge: the system is the problem, not each other. We must unite and advocate for our kids. As a matter of fact, MFT is also doing some advocacy for the continuation of the ESSER [Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief] funding. So I’m doing everything that I can.

Minneapolis Public Schools enacted painful budget cuts last year when COVID relief funding expired and is expected to cut more this year. How do you think the school district should approach budget cuts when they’re necessary? What do you think needs to happen to shore up district finances so cuts are not necessary in the future?

What I’m doing is what I mentioned to you. I was the school board member that, along with Representative [Frank] Hornstein, brought together the Minneapolis delegation, the Hennepin County Board — currently doing work with Chair [Irene] Fernando and also Commissioner [Marion] Greene.

They are very incredible leaders, but I mean, I have reached the point that every single governing body has a responsibility and an obligation to invest in our kids. So we’re having those conversations currently. I’m not waiting, I’m doing it right now.

Basically, I’m bringing all of us together. I’m not going to stop until people get the point. We want change. We must invest in our babies. Shame on people that don’t see it that way, and that get politics in the way, and that is for both Democrats and Republicans. I’m the person that is not afraid to speak up the truth. I’ve got nothing to lose.

We’re too late. We should have started a long time ago with this. But it is what it is. I mean, we have gone through a lot. When Ed Graff decided to leave, and then having an interim [superintendent], and then a new superintendent. So it should have started earlier, bottom line.

Anyway, I don’t know where we are, because we have not started the process, but what I can tell you is that we have a lot of newcomers. That is poetic justice in the sense that we’re talking about money, first of all, that is not being accounted for. I don’t know where we are going to be. I don’t have a response to that.

What are the most important steps you think the district can take to reverse enrollment declines?

That’s the thing. I don’t feel like our numbers are declining. We have gained, I don’t know what’s the exact number of newcomers to the district. In that sense, immigrants, we are saving the district from lack of enrollment. We are, in some schools, at full capacity. I don’t think that we are talking about those realities. Even schools like Hmong International, a lot of our newcomers are there, and their numbers were really low.

What needs to be done for the families now that are being let down by the district? Because there has been a culture of unaccountability. It’s being present in the community. Number one is to put accountability in leadership, and that means school leadership: principals. What needs to be done is holding people accountable so that we can better serve our families.

There’s a growing demand in the district for language and cultural programs. How do you think the district should respond to those demands in a time of financial strain?

I actually started to advocate for the expansion of the Spanish dual-immersion program since Rochelle [Cox] was our interim [superintendent]. There is a popular demand — not just a demand, it’s a popular demand, from all of our families, not only families that speak Spanish. It’s an investment to really help to create bilingual leaders.

So it’s going to come to a point when we understand where we are with our buildings and the programs, and we continue the advocacy. How do we do it? We only do it together. I’m very hopeful because I will not stop advocating to fully fund our schools.

How do you think Minneapolis Public Schools can support and retain new immigrant families?

I feel like we are doing it. The first day of school, I came to help a family that was looking [at] options to come back to MPS. And when I came into the Davis Center, the admissions office was packed. It was overflowing with newcomers. I ended up staying for two hours to help translate.

We have an amazing welcoming staff who are mindful when it comes to newcomers and immigrant families. I’m very proud of the staff. The work they have done is incredible. My advocacy to bring in more diverse staff is paying off.

What are you proud of from your service on the school board?

So many things. Bringing interpreters to all of our school board meetings. That was hard work before getting elected, and then allocating the funding after getting elected. The communications department: now, everything that comes out to our families, it’s in our native tongue. That’s huge! That did not exist before.

Now, you go to the website, at least we can cover some of the most spoken languages. It gives you the option: Español, Somali, Hmong. Change of leadership. That’s historical. The first Latine academic department created in the history of this district, for goodness sake. The Anishinaabe resolution that I introduced, my first resolution ever, for something that was long due.

The relationships with our new leadership, with the board, I feel like it’s the fruits of the labor. It has not been easy. And when I take my nephew to school every day, I get to see our beautiful kids. I’m connected. So what I’m proud of: it’s community, the positive things that I do see, the endless possibilities.

What’s another school board priority of yours we haven’t talked about?

Holding each other accountable. My priority is to hold myself accountable and to deliver for our children."

District 2 represents north Minneapolis. El-Amin is running unopposed. She served as school board chair in 2023.

Name: Sharon El-Amin Age: 53 Day job: Executive director, McKinley Community Center; incumbent school board member Kids in the district: Her kids graduated from Minneapolis Public Schools, and her grandchildren currently attend.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why are you running for reelection to the Minneapolis school board?

Over the last four years, I have been able to collaborate and work with the school board, for one, to have consistency amongst the board for the work that needs to be done.

Just being in north Minneapolis, it’s critical for us to have leaders from amongst us that actually knows our community, that’s affected by these decisions that are being made in our community. And being a part of the community, you understand better. You are able to bring more to the table when you’re actually a leader from within the community.

What do you love about Minneapolis Public Schools?

One, we have educators and staff that are really compassionate and really dedicated to the work that needs to be done within our schools. Within my district, you find teachers that are really rooted and committed and wanting to build relationship[s] with our youth, our scholars that are in the classrooms.

Also, the diversity that we find within our schools. I think that’s the uniqueness about our Minneapolis Public Schools, when it comes to staffing or when it comes to the opportunities that are available throughout our district. Over the last few years, trying to have more parent involvement and engagement. I’m loving seeing that unfold and become more of a standard within our district as well.

As you know, Minneapolis Public Schools enacted painful budget cuts last year when COVID relief funding expired, and is expected to cut more this year. How do you think the school district should approach budget cuts when they’re necessary, and what do you think needs to happen to shore up district finances so cuts are not necessary in the future?

As a board member, that is one of the most critical parts of our job: to be fiscally, financially responsible for things that are happening within our district. So we know that all this money came in from the ESSER [Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief] dollars that were given to us, but we know that it was a temporary relief. We found some things that worked for us and some things that did not.

I think the key for us right now is, as we go through the transformation, is to get inside of our schools, see what the needs are, hear from our community, and just really make decisions based on what our needs are and what we can actually provide to make sure that our children, our students, our teachers and our community feel supported and feel like they have an opportunity for their children to excel.

Those are really the main things for me that I think we need to focus on within our district: our academics. We have to make sure that our children have the opportunity to excel. And so when we look at our budget, our budget should reflect that.

We should be able to look at our budget and see where our priorities are within our district. We’ve got to find that there are things we have to give up in order to make other things work more collectively and together for the wellbeing of our students and staff.

I don’t know if it’s appropriate for me to say whether we should close or consolidate. My hope is in this transformation, we’ll get inside and we’ll see what the need is. We can’t continue to operate on a budget as if we have over 50,000 students, and we don’t. So we have to make critical decisions.

It’s just like in your home, if someone loses their job, you can’t continue to live at a rate that you’ve been living on if that income is no longer coming in.

So you have to make changes. There’s going to be some critical changes. But that’s a discussion that has to be made as a whole within the community, with parents, with educators, so that we’re making that decision not based on individuals and what they think, but based on what [the] community needs and what families will support.

So there may be some closure[s]. There may be some consolidation. We have to be open to all of that. The goal is for us to remain student-centered, for our students to get what they need when it comes to academics, when it comes to making sure that they have an opportunity to explore and have the opportunity to see what other avenues are out here for them.

That’s what we have to do as a district. We have to be able to provide the resources, the academics and the education that’s needed for our families, but we have to have support and buy-in from our families and from our educators.

What are the most important steps you think the district can take to reverse enrollment declines?

I think focusing on academics. I think we show that we have all the tools and the mechanisms to make sure that when your child is in the district, that they have an opportunity to succeed when it comes to academics. All of our children should be able to read at their grade level and above, and I’m going to say above, because grade level is just not enough for me. I want to push for us to do more.

We have to set the bar higher for our children and give them something to be able to reach for, to grasp for, to achieve. So we can show that our children are able to excel when our children have the resources, when our children have the staffing in those schools that’s needed. The mental support is there. The academic support is there. The school is inviting and it’s welcoming when you walk in and that all those different channels are being met.

Then, families will buy into it. Families will support. Families will want to have their children in that atmosphere, because it will present opportunities for academic excellence. It will have an opportunity that shows the safety, well-being. It will show that we understand the mental, social-emotional impact and support that is needed for our children.

For me, that’s what each one of our schools should represent. It shouldn’t matter if they’re in my district or in another district. All of our schools should represent those same core values of what we can expect when we put our children into our Minneapolis Public Schools.

There’s a growing demand in the district for language and cultural programs. How do you think the district should respond to those demands in a time of financial strain?

Again, I think as we look at the transformation, and we walk through the schools and we see, how can we provide this? Because it is a need. It is a need, and not only is it a need for our students that are coming into the school system, but it’s also an opportunity for other cultures to be able to learn and get this advantage while they’re in our school district.

So if that is a priority within our district, if that is a priority for what our parents are saying they want and need, and if that is a priority within our community as a district, we have to figure out how to make that priority show up in our budget.

How do you think Minneapolis Public Schools can support and retain new immigrant families?

The needs are going to show up differently. So if we can create those avenues where we have schools that are fully funded, it gives us more of an opportunity to provide those services. But I also think partnerships are going to be critical for our schools and the things that we are trying to work on.

Maybe it’s not necessarily the resources right in the schools itself, but there’s a connection and a resource that we can connect our families with. So it doesn’t have to be something that’s housed in schools, but where’s the community connection? Where can we still help that family that is in need, whether it’s housing, clothing, food, shelter? How do we connect those dots until schools are fully funded?

Right now, to me, that’s really about the partnerships that need to be created throughout our city to make sure that we can support the families as they come into our school districts.

What are you proud of from your service on the school board?

I think there’s a number of things over the last four years that I’ve been able to accomplish.

One, when we worked on the opportunity for our religious holidays to be shared amongst all faiths, to have the Eid recognized on the calendar was huge for me as a Muslim, being able to recognize and for my children, my grandchildren, friends of mine to know that we are recognized, and our religion is just as critical and important as others. So having the other faiths’ religion to be recognized for their holy holidays was very critical for me.

As chair, being able to get our board to go through more of a governing process. In the time that I served as chair, we were able to put together a school board handbook for our school board members to come in to actually have something to walk away with.

We were able to do more governing training so that school board members that are coming in understand their role, what it is that they’re responsible for, and how to really govern when it comes to school board decisions.

And then bringing in a Black superintendent under our leadership, again as chair, those things were critical for me, too. And then just trying to get us to start walking through this process of transformation within our district has been something that I’m proud to be a part of and look forward to continuing.

What’s another school board priority of yours we haven’t talked about?

I think again, academics is what I will be putting a lot of my focus and energy on. Our children, our Black and brown children, for too long have not been able to read and write at grade level. So we have to figure out, what is it that’s missing?

Why is it that our Black and brown children can’t seem to move the needle when it comes to reading and writing, even if these children are showing up on a daily basis in school? What is it that’s not being done? What is it that we need more of? How do we get families the support that is needed?

So I plan to put all of my attention into academics. I think it’s critical for us to see the academics and the literacy amongst our children rise over the next few years within our district."
"Meet Joe Teirab, the Republican challenging Angie Craig for the Second District",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/joe-teirab-minnesota-congress-2024-election-angie-craig-opponent/,2024-10-14,"Joey Peters, More Joey Peters, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SJ103988.jpg,"Joe Teirab was in eighth grade when he visited his dad’s village in Sudan for the first time. The huts with thatched roofs and farm animals wandering freely were an eye-opening experience for him.

“I remember they slaughtered a goat for us,” Teirab said. “It felt very much like: this is probably what people have done for thousands of years if someone came back after being gone for many, many years.”

Teirab’s dad grew up in “abject poverty,” and immigrated to the United States in the 1970s for college. He married a Minnesota woman with German and Norwegian roots, and together they raised Teirab and his brother in the rural southwestern Minnesota city of Windom. Teirab says he and his brother were two of three people of color in school in the 1990s and 2000s.

“That’s a dynamic that I think shapes you as a person,” Teirab said. “I think it would hopefully make me a kind of a different kind of person in Congress, especially as a Republican.”

Teirab is running to unseat Congresswoman Angie Craig to represent Minnesota’s Second Congressional District. Running for office for the first time, 37-year-old Teirab promotes himself as a fresh face and pragmatic choice for a district that could swing either way.

He’s a lifelong Republican who was executive director of Cornell University Republicans during his undergraduate years in the 2000s.

Craig, a moderate Democrat, has painted Teirab as inexperienced and out of touch with the district.

“While Joe Teirab has spent most of his time pointing fingers and complaining, Rep. Craig has focused on finding the concrete solutions needed to lowering costs for working families: making sure they can find cheaper gas options when they fill up their tanks, capping seniors’ insulin copays at $35/month and getting rid of federal taxes on Social Security,” Craig’s campaign spokesperson Katie Kelsh said in a written statement.

Teirab’s background includes a Harvard law degree, service in the U.S. Marines and work as a federal prosecutor. As an assistant U.S. Attorney, Teirab worked on cases involving drug trafficking, gang activity and government fraud in the Feeding Our Future case. He left the office last year to run for Congress.

The race promises to be the most closely watched Congressional races in Minnesota, and one of the more closely watched contests in the country, with possible implications for which political party wins or retains control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans currently hold a slim nine-seat majority.

The Second District, which encompasses the southern Twin Cities suburbs and extends into parts of rural southern Minnesota, contains “probably the only competitive Congressional race that’s going on right now,” said Michael Brodkorb, a former Minnesota Republican Party deputy chair who has lived in the district for 20 years.

The district was a Republican stronghold for most of the 2000s and part of the 2010s, when former Republican Congressman John Kline represented it for 14 years and won elections by comfortable margins. That started to change in 2016, when Craig first ran and narrowly lost to Congressman Jason Lewis, a Republican, by less than two points.

Craig was elected two years later, beating Lewis by just under five points, and has held onto the district ever since.

Craig’s closest reelection effort came in 2020, a presidential election year with former President Donald Trump on the ticket. Craig beat challenger Tyler Kistner that year by just over two percentage points.

Teirab is hoping that this election year, which once again features Trump on the ticket, will lead to another strong Republican turnout to put him over the top. Trump formally endorsed Teirab in the election, calling him a “terrific America First Candidate,” and Teirab backs Trump wholeheartedly.

But during a recent interview at his Burnsville campaign office, Teirab’s rhetoric bore little resemblance to Trump’s.

Teirab, for example, declined to define himself as a MAGA Republican.

”I’m a Republican who wants to help our country get back on track,” he said. “I don’t like labels.”

On immigration

Teirab described himself as the “proud son” of an immigrant, and recalled a childhood watching his dad compile, photocopy and fill out scores of immigration forms to help bring family members over to the United States.

“It was so cumbersome,” he said. “It took so much time.”

Teirab’s dad came to the United States in the 1970s on an education visa to study veterinary medicine at Kansas State University. He later obtained a PhD in microbiology at the University of Minnesota, and worked as an inspector for the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 30 years, inspecting meat-packing plants.

Teirab, a non-denominational Christian, said in his faith “there’s a sense of supporting the sojourner.”

“I think we can talk about the issue of immigration in a way that’s respectful when we’re not vilifying people who want to come here,” he said.

At the same time, Teriab said “there’s no semblance of law and order on the border,” which leads to “a power vacuum that empowers bad actors like the cartels who are now in control of the border.”

He supports funding more resources for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the deportation of some immigrants currently in the country illegally.

More funding for border patrol could provide resources to catch and turn away people who are crossing the border illegally, Teirab said, and give border agents more resources to process people seeking asylum in the United States. He also favors reinstituting Trump’s “remain in Mexico” policy where asylum seekers would have to stay in Mexico as they await processing.

Teirab said he supports deporting undocumented immigrants who arrived here recently, but not those who’ve been here for a long time.

“I don’t think rounding up folks who have been here for 20 years is the right course of action,” he said.

He did not provide a clear definition of who should be considered recent immigrants eligible for deportation, though he said people who’ve come here illegally “in recent years” and under President Joe Biden’s administration should be eligible.

When asked whether he supports Trump’s pledge to conduct the biggest deportation program in the nation’s history, Teirab did not respond directly.

“If we’re going to expel folks who recently came here illegally, I don’t know if that would end up amounting to the largest deportation program in history,” he said. “Maybe it would.”

Craig has criticized Biden’s immigration record and emphasized that she voted multiple times with Republicans to condemn the Biden administration’s policies on the U.S.-Mexico border. She’s characterized Republicans, including Teirab, as unserious on the issue after Republican Senators killed a bipartisan border security bill over the summer following Trump’s criticism that such a bill would be a “gift” to Democrats.

“Angie believes the only way we make progress toward creating a fast and fair immigration system is by working together,” Kelsh said. “Last year, she visited the southern border with a group of her colleagues to speak with people on the ground about what was happening and how Congress could help.

“Since then, she’s worked with those same colleagues to help secure the resources, tools and support needed to bring order and safety to the border.”

On abortion

Craig has made Teirab’s history as an anti-abortion activist a campaign issue. Teirab spoke out against abortion as an undergraduate at Cornell University, and sits on the board of New Life Family Services, a pregnancy resource center that discourages women from obtaining abortions.

This featured most prominently in a TV ad with a female obstetrician gynecologist warning that Teirab would “let politicians ban abortion even in cases of rape, incest and in the event that the life of the mother is at risk.”

The ad, which KSTP-TV deemed as misleading, is based on Teirab’s answer to a question in a questionnaire from Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, an anti-abortion group. The question reads, “Would you vote against any legislation that would weaken any pro-life law or policy that is in effect on the day that you are elected?”

Teirab marked yes.

Craig has emphasized that nearly half of all states have banned or restricted abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and that 10 states have completely banned abortion in all cases. Carig is the author of federal legislation that would legalize abortion nationally similar to the way it was for a half century under Roe v. Wade.

“What Joe has done is pledged to Minnesota Concerned Citizens for Life that he will do nothing to stop those states from banning abortion even in the case of rape and incest,” Craig said in an October 4 debate with Teirab hosted by Minnesota Public Radio.

Craig also criticizes New Life Family Services for offering “abortion pill reversals,” among other things.

Teirab counters that while he’s against abortion personally, he has pledged to vote against any nationwide abortion ban of any kind should he be elected to Congress.

Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, abortion is now a state issue and not a federal issue.

“I do think that there’s a difference between what the federal government’s role is and what the state government’s role is,” Teirab said.

One of his answers in the Minnesota Concerned Citizens for Life questionnaire appears to contradict this stance. Teirab marked yes to a question asking, “Do you recognize a Federal role in protecting unborn children?”

Teirab told Sahan Journal that this stance amounts to his support of a federal role “in doing what we can to support adoption and foster care.”

He also marked yes to the question: “Would you vote for chemical abortion legislation related to restricting its use, supporting the collecting and reporting of data on complications, or increasing safeguards for women?”

The questionnaire was referring to medication like mifepristone and misoprostol which can be taken during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy to terminate a pregnancy. The medications make up the majority of abortions in the country.

Teirab told Sahan Journal he supports the last two points of the question — collecting and reporting data on complications and increasing safeguards for women regarding abortion medication — but not the first half of the question. He said he would vote against any restrictions on medicines that induce abortion.

Craig’s campaign said Teirab’s past activism against abortion rights means he can’t be trusted on the issue.

“He has spent his entire life working to get rid of abortion in this country — that doesn’t just conveniently change when there’s an election in a few weeks,” Kelsh said.

Activist Republicans cold to Teirab

Despite the district’s reputation as a swing district, Craig is in a strong position for reelection. She has raised more than three times the amount of money as Teirab — $6.1 million to $1.7 million — according to the most recent campaign finance reports.

And Craig has one thing that Teirab doesn’t, according to Brodkorb: complete support from her political party.

“Angie has everything working in unison to make sure, in unison, that she’s elected,” he said.

Teirab, on the other hand, does not have formal support from Minnesota Congressional District 2 Republicans. The district’s Republican Party was firmly behind Teirab’s primary challenger, Taylor Rahm, who ran to the right of Teirab.

Rahm was Republican Party activists’ preferred candidate, originally winning the state party endorsement by an overwhelming delegate vote of 74 percent to Teirab’s 25 percent.

Rahm dropped out of the race one month before the August primary to take a job with the Trump campaign. But Rahm’s name remained on the ballot, his campaign literature continued to be mailed out and some of his supporters kept Rahm lawn signs up through the primary. Ultimately, Teirab won the primary with 76 percent of the vote; Rahm earned 24 percent.

In the wake of the win, Teirab’s own district Republicans have still neglected to endorse him. Some Rahm supporters have said they don’t plan to vote for Teirab, calling him an establishment candidate. However, Joe Ditto, chair of Minnesota Congressional District 2 Republicans, said Teirab has not prioritized the endorsement.

“We attempted to take up the business of endorsement at our August meeting,” Ditto wrote in a text message to Sahan Journal. “However, Teirab was unable to attend so we removed the item from the agenda.”

Teirab said the lack of endorsement is “not a big deal.”

“There’s a small group of people who are part of that decision making process that obviously don’t reflect Republicans in the district,” Teirab said. “Because the Republicans overwhelmingly supported me to go against Angie Craig.”

Brodkorb, an anti-Trump Republican who has voted for Craig and who supports Democrat Kamala Harris for president, said it’s “astonishing” how local Republicans have treated Teirab.

“The leadership of the Second District Republicans are some of the most extreme members of the Republican Party that exist in this state,” Brodkorb said. “They think that they are Republicans in a congressional district in Alabama.”

Although Brodkorb is undecided on how he will vote for Congress, he spoke highly of Teirab and believes he can appeal to many voters in the district. Most of the district’s voters are not looking for a candidate who will align with Trump 100 percent of the time, he said.

“The challenge right now is that in a swing district like this, every bit of the machinery needs to be functioning together,” Brodkorb said. “And right now, I think the Democrats in the district are unified and excited around Angie Craig’s candidacy and the Republicans are somewhat still fractured.”

AK Kamara, a Republican National Committee member for Minnesota, said that Teirab may be an underdog in the race but that he is a strong candidate for the district.

“I am a pretty hardcore right wing ideological person,” Kamara said. “But I will support people who are not exactly that, because if they reflect the district that they’re in and and they’re able to win, that’s really what matters.”"

All seats in the Minnesota House of Representatives are also up for grabs and one seat in the state Senate will feature a special election. Democrats narrowly control both branches in the Minnesota Legislature, which Republicans could potentially take after ballots are counted.

This is true even for the state Senate, which Democrats held control of by only one seat until state Senator Kelly Morrison, DFL-Deep Haven, resigned earlier this year to focus on her candidacy for Congress. A special election in the west Twin Cities suburban seat will determine if Democrats or Republicans control the Senate.

There are also several city and county races across the state.

Election Day is Tuesday, November 5, but early voting is already under way. Sahan Journal breaks down everything you need to know about casting your ballot now and on Election Day.

I want to vote before Election Day. Can I do this in person?

Yes. But you probably cannot vote early at the polling place where you would cast a ballot on Election Day. The best way to find an early voting polling place is to go to the Minnesota Secretary of State’s website and click on the county you live in.

There, you’ll find the polling places and hours for early voting locations for your city. You can also find the phone number for your county election office at this link.

How do I vote by mail?

You can apply online at the Secretary of State’s office if you want to vote by mail using an absentee ballot. Fill out the application here, which is available in 10 languages, including English, Spanish, Somali and Hmong.

After you submit your application, which you can do online or by mail, the Secretary of State will mail your absentee ballot to your home address.

You will need a witness to sign your absentee ballot. The witness can be any registered Minnesota voter.

You must then mail your ballot back before November 5, Election Day. Your ballot must arrive at your county election office by this date. A return address will be listed on the ballot mailed to you.

The Secretary of State recommends that voters mail their ballots at least a few days before November 5 to ensure that the office receives it in time.

If you mail your ballot, you can track its status online at this link.

If I forget to mail my absentee ballot before November 5, can I still return it before polls close?

You can drop off your absentee ballot in person at your county’s ballot drop box. Click here for a list of addresses for county drop boxes.

If you do not see your county listed, drop off your absentee ballot at the same election office that mailed your ballot. Voters have until 8:00 p.m. on November 5 to drop off their absentee ballots in person.

Can someone else drop off my absentee ballot for me?

Voters who are physically unable to vote or drop off their absentee ballot can request an agent to deliver their ballot for them.

This includes voters who are hospitalized or living in a nursing home, assisted living center or battered living shelter, among others. The agent must have a preexisting relationship with the voter and must be at least 18 years old.

Voters who want to use an agent to drop off their ballot must fill out this form: https://www.sos.state.mn.us/media/1915/request-for-agent-delivery-of-absentee-ballot.pdf.

Agents can start delivering ballots seven days before Election Day up to until the polls close at 8 p.m. on November 5, Election Day. Agents must present valid IDs when they drop off ballots. They cannot be an agent for more than three voters, and cannot be a candidate running for public office.

When is the last day for early voting?

The last day you can vote early is Monday, November 4, the day before Election Day.

Where do I vote in person on Election Day?

Go to your designated polling place, which you can find by visiting the Secretary of State’s website here: https://pollfinder.sos.state.mn.us.

How do I register to vote on Election Day?

Minnesota allows same-day registration. Go to your designated polling place and bring one of the following proof of residence:

A valid I.D. with your current address listed on it, which can include a driver’s license, a learner’s permit or a receipt for either if you are waiting for them in the mail.

An expired I.D. and a bill, lease agreement or student fee statement showing your current address. If you are living in student housing, an expired I.D. will be enough to allow you to register to vote.

A person who can vouch for where you live. This can be a housemate or neighbor who is able to tell the poll worker that you live at the address you use to register to vote. All they need to do is tell the poll worker that you live where you say you live.

If you live in the same precinct as you voted in the last election but moved to a different home, you don’t need to bring anything to the polls with you; just tell the poll worker that you moved.

If you registered late, defined as within 20 days before Election Day, bring the Notice of Late Registration that you received in the mail with you to the polls.

When are the polls open?

Most polls around the state must open at 7 a.m. on Election Day. Towns with less than 500 people aren’t required to open polls until 10 a.m.

Polls close at 8 p.m., but you can vote later as long as you are in line by 8 p.m.

What if I’m working all day on Election Day?

If you work during polling hours, state law allows you to take time off work on Election Day for the purpose of voting without using vacation or personal leave.

Employers who deny employees the right to vote are subject to misdemeanor charges. If your work violates this law, you are encouraged to file a complaint with your local county attorney.

Can I access ballots and other election materials in languages other than English?

All polling places in Minnesota are required to post voting instructions in Spanish, Hmong and Somali.

In all precincts where 3 percent or more of the precinct population speaks English “less than very well,” according to U.S. Census data, the polling place is required to carry instructions and sample ballots in the most commonly spoken languages in the precinct.

Can I request an interpreter at the polls?

Yes, but you must file a request in advance.

If you want an interpreter, you must live in a precinct where 20% or more of the population speaks English “less than very well.” You must then get 10 or more registered voters to sign a form from the Secretary of State’s Office asking for in-person interpretive services at your polling place on Election Day.

That form can be found here.

Where can I see a sample ballot?

You can view what your ballot will look like by entering your home address on the Secretary of State’s website here.

Can I call someone if I have more questions?

You can call the Secretary of State’s office at 1-877-600-VOTE (8683) or contact your county election office at this link."

Her first reaction was incredulity. But when she turned on the TV, and later saw people — including some of her followers — reposting the false claims on social media, she began to feel alarmed.

“To be honest, I am trying to keep my calm,” she said. “I started to worry and I don’t want to receive threats against the school.”

Mingo-Holtz, who founded Mes Amis French School in 2005, is one of approximately 4,000 Haitian Minnesotans. Many are here under temporary protected status (TPS) or humanitarian parole. Others are U.S. citizens.

All say the false rumors about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, later amplified by former President Donald Trump, add to the stress and uncertainty they feel about their welcome here.

“Personally, it traumatizes me,” said Florencia Pierre, a Haitian artist and community organizer based in Minnesota. “You feel that you always have to fight to be appreciated by others, you’re so stressed that you develop cardiovascular illnesses.”

Pierre, also called “Maman Fofo” in the community, moved to the U.S. after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. She joined her daughter, Djenane Saint Juste, who had left a few months earlier. Since then, the family has not been able to move back to Haiti because of the insecurity and political instability.

After the earthquake, the Obama administration granted TPS to Haitian nationals. Today, 200,000 Haitians live in the United States under TPS, a status that Pierre described as a limbo.

Every 18 months, her family has to pay and renew their protection and their eligibility depends on the will of the president. In 2017, Donald Trump paused TPS for nationals from Haiti, Nepal, Sudan, Nicaragua and El Salvador, but a federal judge blocked his plan.

“We are not moving forward,” Saint Juste said. “We have the security of not being kidnapped, but other than that, it is a tragedy. It is a constant traumatism.” After 15 years living in the U.S., Saint Juste was refused her green card application.

Black feminist theorist and writer Beaudelaine Pierre describes TPS as a “constant state of dispossession.” Previously a scholar at the University of Minnesota and now teaching at the University of Massachusetts, Pierre said immigrants not only have to pay to constantly renew their status, but they’re also separated from family.

“You cannot even go home,” Pierre said. “People on TPS can apply to travel outside the US, but it costs $600, and it comes six months after. That means many of us lose parents, lose fathers and mothers.” Without an authorization to leave the country, immigrants on TPS cannot return to the U.S.

Beaudelaine Pierre was not surprised by Vance and Trump’s claims. “What was said in the debate is a reflection of how Haitian folks are treated on an everyday basis,” she said.

She said the false claims about legal Haitian immigrants in Ohio reflect the anti-Haitian sentiment ingrained in U.S. institutions and imagery.

“Many Haitians know that whatever their level of integration is in the U.S., since 1804, following the independence of the country, they have been punished, systematically by the U.S. government, because of the fight for their freedom,” Pierre said.

Haiti was the first free Black republic in the Western Hemisphere and Pierre noted that slave owners feared that it would inspire other Black people during an era when slavery was still legal in the U.S.

Building community

In Minnesota, culture and tradition help the Haitian community persevere. Saint Juste funded the cultural organization Afoutayi, to celebrate Haitian culture, dance, music and fashion. “Maman Fofo” dances, acts, sews the clothing for Afoutayi and cooks for the community.

Every year on May 18, Saint Juste organizes the Haitian Flag Day celebration. The event started with only 10 people, and now more than 200 attend. But Afoutayi recently lost its lease and the community struggles to find spaces to come together, Saint Juste said.

Haitian community organizer David Policard noticed that the community was fractured because of the different waves of Haitian immigration. Newly arrived immigrants reach out to churches, Somali or Hmong organizations. But they often face language issues, as few people speak French or Créole.

Last week, Policard launched his organization Vanse, a platform to help Minnesota’s Haitians access jobs and services.

“When they come here, it is difficult to access higher-paying jobs that would allow them to progress out of poverty,” he said.

Policard enrolled his young son at Mes Amis French School. It is a space where the child can speak French, stay connected with his Haitian roots outside of home, and Mingo-Holtz sometimes talks to him in Créole as well.

“Beyond language, I wanted a school where he would be seen and treated as himself, not ‘othered,’” Policard said.

Vance and Trump’s racist claims have also reached schools, where Haitian children have been bullied. For Sainte Juste, there is a risk that some kids will later refuse to be associated with their Haitian identity because of this bullying.

Jude Vales is the principal at Adams Spanish Immersion School in St. Paul. He has not witnessed or heard any case of bullying in his school so far. Personally, he felt offended but not surprised by Vance’s claims.

“For many Haitians it wasn’t new, because we are used to inept, incompetent politicians,” said Vales. “Whenever there is an election, they use us as a scapegoat.”

Instead of providing solutions or policies, those politicians focus on race and target Black immigrants, Vales said. It is part of a white supremacist playbook, he said. Trump had previously targeted Haitians in the U.S., claiming that Haiti is a backward country and that Haitians have AIDS.

For Vales, the way to counter this narrative actually resides in schools. “The first way to be engaged is to get yourself educated, to educate children and make sure your children know their history, and also know the history of this nation which has become theirs as well.”

The other solution for him is to go to the polls next month and keep organizing.

Harris-Walz campaign kicks off a nationwide effort to reach Native voters,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/harris-walz-campaign-connect-native-voters/,2024-10-03,"Melissa Olson, More Melissa Olson, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1-1.png,"This story comes to you from MPR News through a partnership with Sahan Journal.

The Harris-Walz campaign kicked off a nationwide effort to earn the votes of Native Americans.

Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan spoke Wednesday at the launch of “Native Americans for Harris-Walz,” a new effort by the campaign to reach out to Native American voters. The midday event was held at the Mystic Lake Event Center, a complex owned by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community.

A key issue raised by Flanagan and others who spoke at the event was the protection of women from violence, and the protection of Indigenous women and girls, in particular.

“We’ve been crystal clear that our women are sacred, and worth protecting,” said Flanagan.

Flanagan is a citizen of the White Earth Nation, a tribal nation in the northwestern part of the state. She was elected alongside Gov. Tim Walz in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.

Tribal leaders from across the country showed their support for the democratic ticket.

Tribal chair of the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians, Mark Macarro touted Walz’s record on tribal-state relations in Minnesota.

“In Minnesota Governor Walz has said a precedent by visiting all 11 tribal nations and signing legislation to codify government to government relations,” said Macarro.

In 2021, Walz signed legislation mandating state agencies consult with tribal nations on issues affecting tribes across the state and requiring state employees to attend training on how to improve relations with tribal nations.

A 2020 report to the Minnesota Legislature found that “although American Indian women and girls made up just 1 percent of the state’s population from 2010 through 2018, 8 percent of all murdered women and girls in Minnesota were American Indian.”

A co-author of that report, Nicole Matthews, attended the event in support of the Harris-Walz ticket. Matthews is the executive director of the Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition.

Matthews said she recently returned from an event at the White House where she had been invited by President Joe Biden to speak to the successes of the Violence Against Women Act, federal legislation responding to domestic violence and sexual assault.

Matthews said she wants to see work on Violence Against Women Act continue under a Harris administration.

“I’m very hopeful.” said Matthews.

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump opened a cold case task force to investigate unsolved cases involving Indigenous women and girls who are missing or murdered. Ivanka Trump, then serving as her an advisor to her father, led the initiative.

‘She came prepared’

Native American civic leaders from across the Midwest attended in support of the Harris-Walz ticket.

Voting rights organizer Prairie Rose Seminole drove from North Dakota to attend the event. Seminole, a citizen of the Three Affiliated Tribes in North Dakota, said she’s been a supporter of Harris from when she and other Native American voting rights advocates met with her at the White House several years ago.

Seminole said she arrived at the meeting expecting to educate Harris on voting rights issues facing Native Americans.

“We came prepared to do ‘Indian 101’ and we didn’t have to do that,” said Seminole. “She came prepared.”

During the kick-off of the event, Richard Milda, donned his traditional dance regalia alongside others and led a round dance. Milda, a citizen of the Gila River Indian Community, has worked on domestic violence issues.

“I believe in their message,” said Milda.

Milda said he hopes to see Native American treaty rights front and center should Harris and Walz be elected.

“We’re not in the backyard. We’re in the front yard.” said Milda. “Land, hunting, fishing, wild rice gathering and all of those issues are very important.”

Organizers for the Harris-Walz campaign say hosting events in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin are a priority.

Organizers will host two events in New Mexico starting with an event Wednesday with the All Pueblo Council of Governors. Friday, the campaign will visit the Northern Navajo Nation Fair."
"St. Cloud Somali community seeks political influence, but not all share same views",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/st-cloud-somali-community-political-influence/,2024-10-01,"Kirsti Marohn, More Kirsti Marohn, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1.png,"This story comes to you from MPR News through a partnership with Sahan Journal.

As Minnesota’s Somali population has grown, it’s increasingly looking to flex its political muscle. That’s especially true in St. Cloud, where the Somali American population has surged dramatically in recent years.

More than two decades since the first Somali refugees settled in St. Cloud, some community members are seeking a more active role in government and politics by exercising their voting power, sometimes breaking with their traditional allegiance with the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, or DFL.

Other Somali Americans in St. Cloud are running for local offices, hoping to achieve success where others have not.

Abdi Daisane, a small business owner who came to the U.S. 15 years ago, is one of the political hopefuls. He’s the DFL candidate for the state House 14A seat representing St. Cloud and is challenging first-term Rep. Bernie Perryman, a Republican.

Daisane said he and other Somali Americans running for office are active in St. Cloud’s community.

“They have seen the challenges that exist in our community firsthand,” he said. “They have been a part of the solution for a long time.”

Daisane is endorsed by the DFL Party. He said he’s reaching out to all voters in his district, not just Somali Americans, and focusing on core issues such as education, health care and affordable housing.

Other Somali American candidates seeking office include Omar Podi and Hudda Ibrahim, who are running for seats on the St. Cloud City Council. Both survived a primary election in August.

Podi, who moved to St. Cloud in 2012, said he was encouraged to run by members of the Somali community who feel they aren’t represented in city government. He said his goal is to focus on housing and economic development, and help revitalize downtown.

Although the city council race is nonpartisan, Podi has been an organizer for the DFL Party, which has more actively sought to court Minnesota’s Somali voters in previous elections than Republicans.

Still, Podi acknowledges that many in St. Cloud’s Somali-American community – his estimate is 90 percent – are conservative on many social issues, including abortion and gender-affirming topics in public schools.

“The Somali community, I can tell you right now, they lean Republican,” he said.

Podi says more Somali Americans in St. Cloud would vote Republican if the party made them feel more welcome.

Conservative tilt

Nevertheless, when former President Donald Trump spoke to a packed St. Cloud hockey arena in July, the crowd included Somali Americans.

Some were wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats or holding signs voicing their support for the former president, even as the former president called for a crackdown on immigration.

The former president promised tougher border security and “the largest deportation effort in the history of our country.” In a 2016 visit to Minnesota, Trump called the resettlement of Somali refugees “a disaster.”

Some Republican politicians have tried to walk a careful line between support for Trump and St. Cloud’s Somali American residents. Bernie Perryman, the Republican in House District 14A who is being challenged by Abdi Daisane, is trying to do so.

Perryman, a business owner, said she’s been reaching out to knock on doors and connect with all voters in her district, including East Africans. Most don’t specify whether they’re a Republican or Democrat, Perryman said.

“I feel like they just want to be heard about their issues,” she said. “And their issues are the same as ours: affordability, education, safe neighborhoods.”

Farhan Abdi, who’s lived in St. Cloud since 2006, is a Perryman supporter. Abdi has helped with Republican campaigns and vocally supported its candidates. He said the GOP better aligns with his values and stands for family, religion and freedom.

Abdi voted for former President Trump and plans to again, even though he disagrees with some of his anti-immigration rhetoric. Trump’s travel ban on Muslim-majority countries went “too far,” he said.

“At that time, it touched me personally,” Abdi said. “But I knew we are a country of checks and balances … It never changed my view of me sticking with the president.”

Not a monolith

The issue of immigration isn’t clear cut among Somali Americans, said Ahmed Abdi. He has lived in St. Cloud for 20 years and works as a journalist for a local radio station, which produces news for a Somali-speaking audience.

Most Somali Americans came to the U.S. by applying for asylum through the refugee process, he said, and may support Trump’s talk of a border crackdown.

“They say, ‘I don't want people to come to the United States illegally. They can come like us, legally, rather than coming through the border,’” Abdi said.

Matt Lindstrom, a political science professor at the College of St. Benedict/St. John’s University, noted that many Somali Americans have been in the U.S. for 15 to 20 years or longer, and many others were born and raised here. They’re concerned about more issues than just immigration, he said.

“They're buying gas, they're buying food,” Lindstrom said. “They see the inflation. They see rents going up.”

What’s more, some Somali Americans think another Trump presidency could bring more jobs and employment, according to Abdi. Many Muslims also are upset about the Biden administration’s support for the Israeli government in the Gaza conflict, he said, and that could affect whether they vote Democratic or Republican.

An immigrant community develops

Lindstrom is not surprised to see Somali Americans in St. Cloud not just voting on these issues but also seeking a more active role in government and politics. It’s a natural immigration cycle of a community that now has roots in St. Cloud going back two decades, Lindstrom said.

“They feel more empowered,” he said. “They have some of their economic needs taken care of. Some of their social needs are taken care of. And now they have more time, more interest, more capital, both financial and social capital, to make that choice.”

No matter how they end up voting, many Somali residents relish the ability to exercise this right, according to Ahmed Abdi, the St. Cloud journalist.

“I think the first thing people do when they get their citizenship is to vote,” he said. “Because majority of us, we never voted for our elections back in Somalia.”"
Early voting starts Friday in Minnesota.

Mind already made up on who to vote for this election and there’s nothing that is going to change it? Headed out of town in early November? Just want to avoid polling place lines?

Starting Friday, the ability to vote sets in.

Minnesota has one of the earliest early voting periods in the country. And there are multiple ways to do it.

Where do I go to access a ballot, by mail or in person?

To vote early by mail, request an absentee ballot from the Minnesota Secretary of State’s office. It’s now possible to get on a list to automatically get an absentee ballot in each election. Some voters who live in mail-only precincts will automatically get a ballot.

A person who isn’t registered to vote, a separate application for registration will be sent with ballot materials.

Once a ballot arrives, ask a registered Minnesota voter or notary to sign the signature envelope included in absentee ballot materials.

All voters have at least one location in their county where they can vote early with a ballot they received through the mail. Some cities also have early in-person early voting locations. These locations are usually different from a regular polling place. A full list of early voting locations is available on the Minnesota Secretary of State’s website.

Is there a deadline to be aware of?

Leave time for the mail or delivery service to get the ballot back in time.

In order for a ballot to count, a county election office must receive it by Election Day. Absentee ballots can be dropped off in person at the election office that sent the ballot no later than 8 p.m. on Election Day. There are also secured drop boxes in many locations. Voters should not bring their absentee ballot to a standard polling place on Nov. 5.

If a requested absentee ballot by mail doesn’t arrive, gets lost or is damaged, there is a process for receiving a replacement ballot by mail or in person. A county official will cancel the original ballot.

Track the status of a ballot on the Secretary of State’s website.

What happens with my ballot?

Once a ballot is mailed back inside a secrecy envelope, local election officials will make sure the voter and a witness filled out the signature envelope correctly. If it isn’t filled out correctly, election officials will mail replacement materials.

If local election officials receive a ballot that is filled out incorrectly fewer than five days before Election Day, they will try and contact you by phone or email to vote in person instead.

What if I change my mind?

A ballot can get clawed back as long as that happens at least 19 days before Election Day. To cancel a ballot, contact the election office that sent the ballot.

Before then, a person who fills out the ballot and makes a mistake can ask for a replacement ballot. If there isn’t enough time before Election Day to request a new ballot and mail that ballot back, election officials ask that voters fully cross out the name of the candidate accidentally marked. Then select your preferred candidate to make the intent clear.

While ballots can be separated from their secrecy envelopes inside of 19 days of the election and inserted into counters, those votes aren’t tabulated until after polls close.

How do I know what’s on my ballot?

View a sample ballot by entering an address into the My Ballot finder on the Secretary of State’s website.

In addition to candidates for partisan offices, Minnesota voters will also see nonpartisan local races, judicial contests and a statewide ballot measure related to the use of lottery proceeds. Some voters will also encounter local ballot measures from city or county governments or their school district.

MPR News is debuting our voter guides on Sept. 20 to help readers learn more about the candidates running in their district and read candidate responses to key questions.

I’m an out-of-state college student. Can I vote in Minnesota if I don’t have a Minnesota ID?

Paying out-of-state tuition or having a driver’s license from another state doesn’t necessarily exclude a person from voting in Minnesota. Students can register to vote in Minnesota if the address they live at is currently considered home. Update a voter registration info at the polls or online by submitting an approved photo ID and a document that proves current residency.

All colleges and universities that enroll students accepting state financial aid must send election officials a student housing list. These help students prove their Minnesota residency. That list includes students who live on-campus or have provided that off-campus address to the school and live in the city where the campus is located. Those on the list need to bring an approved photo ID to register to vote.

What are the parties doing to promote early voting and why?

A spokesperson for the Minnesota DFL said the party will hold an early voting rally with elected leaders and two “parade to the polls” events.

In a statement, Minnesota DFL Chair Ken Martin said Minnesota offers convenience some other states don’t with one of the earliest starts to voting.

“Minnesota has one of the highest voter turnout rates in the country, and that’s because of state laws like early voting that makes participating in our democracy easy, accessible and secure,” Martin said.

Minnesota Republican Party Chair David Hann said the state party has been encouraging local party leaders to spread the word about early voting during in-person meetings and monthly video calls. Republicans across the country have reversed course after years of criticizing mail voting, and many are encouraging those faithful to the party to vote early if that’s what makes sense for them.

Hann said the law permits early voting and Republicans should take advantage of it even if they have questions about the process.

“We want to make sure people vote, that’s number one,” said Hann. “We want to make sure that nobody is declining to vote because they don’t want to do an early ballot and then maybe their work schedule doesn’t permit them to vote on Election Day.”

For the parties, there is a payoff from early voting. They know there are votes banked from people prone to back their candidates and they can focus turnout efforts on people who have yet to vote. Parties get regular lists of voters who have already submitted ballots.

For voters, an early vote could get them removed from call or door-knock lists, so there is incentive on that end, too.

What do statistics tell us about the interest in early voting?

Many Minnesotans choose to vote early or by mail-in ballot because they’ll be out of town on Election Day, go to out-of-state school or just want to avoid the day-of crowds.

Data collected by the Secretary of State’s office shows that 1.9 million absentee and mail precinct-only ballots were cast in the 2020 general election. That accounted for almost 58 percent of all votes cast in Minnesota in the 2020 election, which was in part due to precautions people were taking during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Those numbers fell in 2022 as pandemic restrictions and precautions eased. Of the more than 2.5 million Minnesotans who voted in the 2022 general election, around 673,000 absentee and mail ballots were accepted."
Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupt University of Minnesota president’s inauguration,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/university-minnesota-walkout-rally-gaza-president-cunningham/,2024-09-18,"Elza Goffaux, Becky Z.

The UMN Divest coalition was protesting the Board of Regents’ decision this summer to take a “position of neutrality” on the university’s endowment. Divestment from Israeli companies and U.S. defense contractors involved in the war in Gaza, which has killed 40,000 Palestinians, was a key demand of student protesters in the spring. Students also object to university guidelines limiting protest activity.

Students began walking out of class and marching toward the auditorium shortly before the 3 p.m. inauguration.

Maryam Wazwaz, a member of American Muslims for Palestine, said Cunningham had not reached out to Palestinian students at the university who had lost family members. And she was frustrated that the university is still investing in companies “profiting from war crimes.”

“She has been ignoring university faculty, staff and students in just the first few months of her presidency,” Wazwaz said, of Cunningham.

Inside Northrop, university officials and local political leaders, including Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, celebrated Cunningham’s ability to lead the university.

Mary Sue Coleman, president emerita of the University of Michigan, highlighted Cunningham’s background as an emergency room physician, noting that she learned to make decisions quickly while consulting with other professionals. “Rebecca has never hesitated to tackle the toughest issues facing our society,” she said. “She always approaches these issues with a strong moral compass.”

As Cunningham introduced herself, explaining how her mother’s years attending night school to obtain a college education lifted her family out of poverty, some students and professors in the auditorium interrupted her remarks.

“You are all complicit with the Israeli genocide in Gaza!” student protesters shouted. Protesters recited a list of demands, including divesting from weapons manufacturers.

About a dozen professors, chanting along with the students and wearing T-shirts that said “Respect the no-confidence vote,” walked out after a second warning. After the third warning, chanting died down as students left the balcony.

Cunningham resumed her remarks to loud cheers, pledging her commitment to providing “an affordable, world-class education.”

Cunningham assumed the presidency on July 1, replacing Interim President Jeff Ettinger. In his final months as president, Ettinger negotiated a peaceful end to a 10-day student encampment, allowing protesters to present their demands for divestment from Israel to the Board of Regents.

Ettinger also reversed a decision to hire the Israeli historian Raz Segal, who described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “genocide,” as director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, following pushback from the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas. After Ettinger withdrew the offer to Segal, the Faculty Senate held a no-confidence vote in both Ettinger and Provost Rachel Croson.

In an August meeting, the Board of Regents voted not to divest from Israel. During that same meeting, Cunningham outlined the approach the university would take to civic engagement this school year. She said that this did not represent new policy, but rather a clarification of existing policy.

Among the tenets of the policy: no more than 100 people can gather in a protest without a permit; each protest can only have one megaphone; signs and posters must fit certain size limits; tents will be prohibited; and protests must conclude by 10 p.m.

Following the inauguration, the university held a celebration outside, as students staged a parallel protest. When Cunningham stopped by a performance of the Red Tree Singers Drum Group, protesters chanted “Cunningham you can’t hide, you are supporting genocide.”

“A lot of people think we have nothing to do with a conflict across the globe, but at the university we have billions of dollars involved,” said Kyle Feldhake, a master’s student, who is originally from Alexandria. He was inside Northrop Auditorium disrupting the ceremony. “Now it is about our right to protest,” he added.

University officials gave warnings to students protesting both inside and outside the inauguration about consequences that would follow if they did not comply with university policy regarding civic engagement. Those potential consequences include suspension.

Jake Ricker, the university’s senior director of public relations, said he wasn’t aware of anyone receiving a formal suspension notice or other discipline.

But Sima Shakhsari, an associate professor of women’s and gender studies, said they came across a group of five students who had been detained for suspension after interrupting the inauguration. Two of the five wore hijabs, Shakhsari said. After Shakhsari questioned why this group had been detained while other students who protested in the same way were not, and asked the university official to call their supervisor, the students were released.

Fae Hodges, student organizer with the UMN Divest Coalition and member of Students for a Democratic Society, said the goal of the action on Wednesday was to relaunch the campaign for divestment and Palestinian rights after protests dwindled during the summer.

“This is a really important time as a new administration comes in to make student voices heard,” Hodges said.

It was the fifth protest the coalition has held since the semester began.

In a September 4 letter to Walz, U.S. House Education Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina, wrote that her committee had already been seeking information from the Walz administration about the fraud, and had been “unable to obtain substantive responsive materials in the many voluntary requests made in this matter.”

“You are well aware of the multi-million-dollar fraud that has occurred under your tenure as Governor,” Foxx wrote. “The Committee must now compel the production of responsive documents that will show the extent of the actions taken by you and your administration relating to [the Minnesota Department of Education’s] administration of the [Federal Child Nutrition Programs] and the extent of your responsibilities and actions addressing the massive fraud that resulted in the abuse of taxpayer dollars intended for hungry children.”

Walz, through a spokesperson in the governor’s office, called the fraud “an appalling abuse of a federal COVID-era program.”

“The state department of education worked diligently to stop the fraud and we’re grateful to the FBI for working with the department of education to arrest and charge the individuals involved,” Walz spokesperson Claire Lancaster said in a prepared statement.

Lancaster added that Walz has “taken dozens of actions to prevent and investigate fraud,” and that the administration is cooperating with the U.S. House Education Committee in its investigation.

What is the Feeding Our Future fraud case?

The case involved the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) distributing federal funds to sponsor organizations like Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit that has since closed. The sponsor organizations then dispersed those funds to food vendors and food sites, which were supposed to provide ready-to-eat meals to local children.

Several of these organizations reported serving thousands more meals than they actually did — or simply never served any meals at all — in order to receive more federal funds, federal prosecutors say. Recipients allegedly spent the money on cars, property, vacations and other items.

The fraud began in the spring of 2020. At the time, several businesses and schools were shutting down to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and the federal government relaxed some of its regulatory practices in order to get money out to programs that served vulnerable populations.

Federal prosecutors estimate that at least $250 million was stolen in Minnesota, and have called the case the largest coordinated COVID-related fraud in the nation. They charged 70 defendants in the case with crimes ranging from wire fraud to money laundering.

What is Walz’s involvement with the Minnesota Department of Education?

As governor, Walz is in charge of the department and all other state agencies. He appoints the commissioners that directly oversee and lead all state agencies, including the department of education.

How much responsibility does Walz bear for the fraud?

This depends on your personal political philosophy, said David Schultz, a political science professor at Hamline University.

“If you take the old Harry Truman adage, ‘The buck stops here,’” Schultz said, “you can say [Walz] is the governor, he oversees the department of education, and he’s ultimately responsible for the actions of his agency, his commissioners and so forth.”

Another interpretation, Schultz said, is that the governor is mainly tasked with appointing commissioners, and that the commissioners and their employees are responsible for their agencies’ day-to-day performance. In that scenario, Schultz said, Walz and the state government are victims of a crime.

“The fact that individuals are indicted, he can say, ‘We were defrauded, too,’” Schultz said. “‘To the best of our ability, we take this money and disburse it, and we were swindled. We are cooperating with federal authorities to get to the root of this.’”

Some state Senate Republicans say Walz is ultimately responsible for the fraud.

“Obviously, you’re not responsible for every operational failure,” said former state Senator Roger Chamberlain. “But you’re responsible overall for how the ship is running.”

Chamberlain chaired the education committee that held hearings in 2022 examining how the department of education handled the fraud. He and other Republicans grilled department employees for not physically monitoring the food sites during the fraud. MDE is tasked with randomly monitoring some food sites in the federal program, but the requirement was waived by the federal government during the pandemic in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus.

“There’s only one person at the top of the chain that’s responsible for every one of those agencies to ensure that they are operating at the highest level,” said state Senator Mark Koran, a Republican from North Branch.

Koran serves as vice chair of the Legislative Audit Commission, which conducted a hearing of the special audit of MDE on Feeding Our Future fraud earlier this year.

How often must the governor check in on state agencies?

State rules and regulations don’t set rules for how often the governor has to check on state agencies. Each governor and their chief of staff determines how often they meet with cabinet heads, and how often and to what extent they’re briefed on an agency’s developments and performance.

“It’s a personal style issue,” Schultz said.

Former Governor Arne Carlson, a Republican who served two terms in the 1990s, had a reputation for being a hands-on micromanager of state agencies. Jesse Ventura, an independent who succeeded Carlson, had the opposite reputation.

“From what I’m hearing, Walz is probably closer to the Ventura model than the Carlson model,” Schultz said.

What has Walz said about the scandal?

Walz has seldom spoken publicly about the scandal. Shortly after the U.S. Attorney’s Office filed the first indictments in the case in September 2022, Walz spoke about the matter at an unrelated news conference, saying that his administration did due diligence to report the fraud early.

“Our administration, very early in the previous presidential administration, noted the irregularities with this,” Walz said at the time. “We alerted folks as quickly as we could. We took that forward. We took the step of stopping payments.”

Walz also referenced a 2020 court case where Feeding Our Future challenged MDE after the state agency delayed applications from nonprofits that wanted to participate in the food-aid program.

MDE eventually paused payments to Feeding Our Future in early 2021, finding the nonprofit “seriously deficient.” Walz said that Ramsey County Judge John Guthmann, who presided over the case, “threatened” then-MDE Commissioner Heather Mueller in 2021 “with jail” by contempt of court if she didn’t resume the payments.

Guthmann said in court that MDE had prematurely stopped payments to MDE without providing enough evidence for the change. MDE resumed making payments to Feeding Our Future.

“We accepted that ruling,” Walz said. “We went back to the new administration once again and went to the FBI, who took this seriously.”

Walz’s comments prompted Guthmann to release his own statement denying that he ever made a ruling forcing MDE to resume payments.

The U.S. House committee requested communications within the Walz administration that refer to Guthmann.

What did the Minnesota Department of Education do to stop the alleged fraud?

MDE first alerted the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Feeding Our Future about suspicious activity in the summer of 2020, a few months after the alleged fraud began.

During the first Feeding Our Future trial earlier this year, MDE’s director of nutrition program services testified that the USDA helped MDE determine that Feeding Our Future and other nonprofits in the food-aid program were “seriously deficient.”

The department also contacted the FBI about the matter in April 2021.

The FBI raided several properties by January 2022 as part of its investigation, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office unsealed search warrants of the raid, making the scandal public. As a result, the state cut off federal funding to Feeding Our Future for good, citing the FBI investigation.

What hasn’t Walz said about the scandal?

It’s unclear when and how Walz was first briefed about the Feeding Our Future case. He hasn’t publicly addressed the question, and a Walz spokesperson contacted for this story declined to speak about the issue.

Minnesota law requires higher-ups in each state agency to report suspected fraud to the state Office of the Legislative auditor. Some Senate Republicans have said that didn’t happen in the Feeding Our Future case.

State law does not address whether and when the governor must be briefed on suspected fraud.

What authority does Congress have to investigate the scandal?

Congress has broad legal authority to compel production of these documents and, if they choose, to bring Walz and others forward to testify at a hearing.

While the subpoena may be politically motivated, it is also a legitimate issue for Congress to investigate, because they appropriated all of the money that was allegedly stolen in the Feeding Our Future case, Schultz said.

“It would be perfectly legitimate to say, ‘We feds gave you a quarter of a billion dollars that we appropriated. A bunch of money has been misspent. How the heck did your department of education not figure this out? Is there somebody in your department of education that’s on the take?’” Schultz said.

Congress also has broad subpoena power, and can hold people who are subjected to a subpoena in contempt of Congress and pursue criminal charges against them if they don’t comply.

Can Congress uncover more than is already known publicly about the case?

Congress’ power to subpoena records and people is much higher than the state Legislature. Chamberlain said he’d like to see Congress question Mary Cathryn Ricker, the former state education department commissioner who served under Walz until Spring 2021. Ricker resigned to return to teaching.

“She was there for the bulk of [the fraud],” Chamberlain said.

Ricker did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

“Congress has more leverage, authority, power to bring some new people in, or get new information from the old witnesses,” Chamberlain said.

Chamberlain added, however, that he isn’t holding his breath for dramatic developments to come from the Congressional investigation.

“What faith do we have in Congress anymore?” he said.

What political impact will the Congressional investigation have on Walz’s run for vice president?

Vice President Kamala Harris announced Walz as her running mate for the presidency on August 6, drawing newfound attention to a governor who had mostly flown under the radar nationally as more prominent Democrats were floated as contenders.

Walz quickly earned a reputation as “coach,” Harris’ favorite nickname for him, and as a fatherly figure. But critics quickly seized on his handling of the protests that followed George Floyd’s murder in 2020, and the Feeding Our Future case as failures in his leadership.

Walz runs a risk if he’s called to testify before the U.S. House committee, Schultz said. But the same is true for Republican members of Congress. If they decide to call Walz to testify before the November 5 election, they take time away from not only Walz, but also from themselves when they could be campaigning for reelection or stumping for Donald Trump.

The Feeding Our Future scandal has historically failed as a line of attack against Walz. He handily won reelection the same year the scandal hit the headlines, earning 52 percent of the vote against Republican challenger Scott Jensen. x

Voters were more concerned that year about typical election issues like inflation, and the price of gas and groceries, Schultz said.

Walz also likely escaped scrutiny because the public could easily blame the unusually large number of defendants who were indicted in the case, he said.

“I don’t think people cared; they had other things to worry about,” Schultz said.

Fallout from the Congressional subpoena and any subsequent action could also be dulled by the fact that Walz is the running mate on the presidential ticket, and not the top candidate.

“Vice presidents don’t matter very much,” Schultz said.

What investigations have been conducted into possible state culpability in the Feeding Our Future fraud?

The Minnesota Senate Education Committee conducted hearings into the matter in 2022, questioning several MDE employees, including then-Commissioner Mueller. Republicans controlled the state Senate at the time.

In those hearings, Mueller characterized MDE’s handling of the fraud as “diligent,” emphasizing that MDE alerted higher-ups early on and was hampered in its actions by Feeding Our Future’s lawsuit.

But state Senate Republicans, led by former state Senator Roger Chamberlain, who chaired the education committee at the time, grilled Mueller and other MDE employees.

To this day, Chamberlain argues that MDE would have caught and prevented the fraud much earlier if staff had visited food sites in person to determine if they were serving the amount of food they reported. The federal government had waived site visits during the pandemic to avoid spreading COVID.

“The checks and balances were there, they just didn’t execute because they didn’t want to,” Chamberlain said.

Mueller argued during the hearings that MDE still found the fraud by reviewing financial statements from Feeding Our Future and other organizations that were involved.

The state Senate committee eventually found MDE at fault for creating an environment ripe for fraud because of its actions and inactions, including not acting on early warnings about Feeding Our Future.

The state Office of the Legislative Auditor released a more detailed audit earlier this year making similar findings, and faulted MDE for allowing the fraud to happen.

Where does the Feeding Our Future case stand now?

Federal prosecutors charged 70 defendants in the case with several crimes; 18 have pleaded guilty.

Jurors convicted five defendants and fully acquitted two others this June in the first case to go to trial. One of the defendants who was acquitted, however, is charged with attempting to bribe a juror in that trial.

No one who pleaded guilty or who was convicted at trial has been sentenced yet.

Two defendants are scheduled to plead guilty this week, and three defendants are scheduled to be jointly tried starting on November 5, the same day as the presidential election."
"Woman admits to bribing Feeding Our Future juror with $120,000 in cash",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/feeding-our-future-trial-bribe-guilty-plea-ladan-ali/,2024-09-05,"Joey Peters, More Joey Peters, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/resized-photos-5-1.png,"A Seattle woman admitted in court Thursday that she bribed a Feeding Our Future juror with $120,000 in cash and tried to trick her co-conspirators into giving her $500,000 for her help.

Ladan Ali, 31, pleaded guilty in federal court in downtown Minneapolis to one count of bribery of a juror. She previously pleaded not guilty in June to conspiracy to bribe a juror, bribery of a juror and corruptly influencing a juror.

Ladan and federal prosecutors agreed to a prison sentence of about 4 ½ and 6 years in prison for her crime, following sentencing guidelines.

Ladan, dressed in a black trenchcoat, high heels, and a black hijab, grew emotional when Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson explained to her that a judge would ultimately decide her sentence, and could go above or below the plea deal’s agreement.

Ladan tearfully responded, “Yes, I do,” as Thompson asked her multiple times whether she understood the situation.

“Knowing all that, do you still want to proceed today,” Thompson asked.

“I do,” Ladan said in a confident voice.

Thompson asked Ladan why she was pleading guilty.

“From the very beginning, I wanted to take responsibility for my actions,” answered Ladan, who did not have any supporters in the gallery.

Ladan was one of five defendants charged in the jury bribery case. Another defendant, Abdimajid Nur, pleaded guilty in July to one count of bribing a juror and agreed to a prison sentence of between 5 to 6 ½ years.

The rest of the defendants — Abdiaziz Farah, Said Farah and Abdulkarim Farah, all of whom are brothers — pleaded not guilty in July to juror bribery charges.

Ladan’s plea hearing offered new information about the attempted bribe. Ladan admitted in court that her initial plan was to take all of the bribe money for herself, but that she ultimately only skimmed $80,000 out of the $200,000 bribe she was given to deliver to the juror.

Ladan and her attorney, Eric Newmark, declined to comment as they left Thursday’s hearing. Ladan has been out of custody since she was charged in June, and was allowed to leave until her sentencing, which has not yet been scheduled.

Bribe rocked highly watched trial

The attempted bribe rocked the end of a six-week trial in the broader Feeding Our Future case. The trial was already intensely watched by the media and public, because it was the first Feeding Our Future case to go to trial. Seventy defendants were charged in the overarching Feeding Our Future case, which involved the alleged theft of $250 million in federal child food-aid funds earmarked to feed underprivileged children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Jurors in the joint trial convicted five of seven defendants of stealing $41 million. Abdimajid, Abdiaziz and Said were defendants in the trial. Abdimajid and Abdiaziz were convicted, Said was acquitted. The other defendants in the trial are not charged in the bribery case.

But a day before the jury was set to begin deliberations, Ladan showed up at the Spring Lake Park home of a 23-year-old woman identified as Juror 52, according to indictments in the bribery case. Prosecutors say that Ladan and her co-defendants targeted Juror 52 because she was the youngest juror and the only person of color on the jury.

Juror 52’s relative answered the door, and Ladan gave him a gift bag with $120,000 in cash and told him to tell Juror 52 that she would receive more money if she voted not guilty during deliberations, according to charges. Juror 52 wasn’t present at the time, but immediately notified police when she arrived home and learned what had happened, prosecutors said.

The situation left Juror 52 shaken, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said at a July hearing in the case.

“Juror 52 was terrified,” Thompson said at the time. “I’ve seen the [police] body cam [footage]. She was crying. She’s still terrified.”

U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel quickly excused Juror 52 from the jury, and sequestered the jury during deliberations to prevent jurors from learning about the attempted bribe.

Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger has said that “the sophistication and intentionality of this plot cannot be overstated.”

Prosecutors allege that the defendants researched Juror 52 online, found information about her and her family and discovered her home address. Abdimajid allegedly recruited Ladan to carry out the bribe.

According to court documents: Ladan, who lives in Seattle, flew to Minneapolis in May to meet with Abdimajid and discuss the plan. She agreed to contact the juror in exchange for $150,000. Ladan tracked Juror 52 as she drove home from a Minneapolis parking ramp, and drove by her home multiple times.

Ladan planned to take it all

In court Thursday, Ladan admitted that she falsely told Abdimajid that she met Juror 52 in a bar and explained the bribe to her. Ladan told Abdimajid that Juror 52 agreed to vote not guilty for a bribe, but wanted $500,000.

Ladan admitted in court that she planned to take the $500,000, or any amount her co-defendants could provide, for herself and ditch plans to offer it to the juror. Ladan told the court she planned to take all of the money because she was worried that the bribe wouldn’t succeed.

Abdimajid believed the story about Juror 52, but could only come up with $200,000, Ladan said Thursday. Ladan confirmed the details by providing yes or no answers to questions from Thompson, and did not speak at length herself.

The initial agreement was that Ladan would drive to the juror’s house and Abdulkarim would follow her in another car and record video of Ladan exchanging the money with the juror. Ultimately, Ladan’s plan to take all of the cash failed when Abdulkarim drove her to the juror’s house himself.

Ladan said Thursday that somewhere along the drive, she successfully pocketed $80,000 for herself, and ultimately dropped off $120,000 at the juror’s home.

The federal government has since recovered the money.

The Feeding Our Future case that led to the attempted bribery involved the Minnesota Department of Education distributing federal funds to sponsor organizations like Feeding Our Future and Partners in Quality Care. The sponsor organizations then dispersed those funds to food vendors and food sites, which were supposed to provide ready-to-eat meals to local children.

Several organizations reported serving thousands more meals than they actually did — or simply never served any meals at all — in order to receive more federal funds, prosecutors say. Recipients allegedly spent the money on cars, property, vacations and other items.

In addition to the five defendants who were convicted at trial, 18 have pleaded guilty.

Ladan, who is not charged in the broader Feeding Our Future case, was connected to a company involved in the alleged fraud, according to information outlined in the bribery charges against her. She is the signatory on a bank account for Afro Produce LLC, which received millions of dollars from companies that prosecutors allege were directly involved in the fraud. She also received checks from Afro Produce in 2021 and 2022, according to court documents.

Afro Produce received more than $1.6 million from three organizations that were run by defendants in the Feeding Our Future trial that led to the bribery case.

Ladan also listed GarGaar Family Services as her employer on her bank account, a company that for a time participated in the federal child food-aid programs."
St. Cloud business owner Abdi Daisane hopes to flip Minnesota House seat to DFL this fall,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/minnesota-legislature-central-minnesota-house-seat-abdi-daisane/,2024-09-02,"Mohamud Farah, More Mohamud Farah, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/resized-photos-3-5.jpg,"A central Minnesota House seat may be in play this year thanks to the region’s changing demographics — and a Somali American candidate who is working to boost voter turnout.

Business owner Abdi Daisane is the DFL-endorsed candidate for House District 14A, which covers parts of St. Cloud, Waite Park and St. Augusta. He’s one of the first people of color to receive the DFL endorsement in central Minnesota, party leaders say.

He is running against Republican incumbent Bernie Perryman, who won the seat by fewer than 200 votes in 2022.

Chantal Oechsle, vice chair of Senate District 14, said Daisane’s candidacy has energized the community and could help drive turnout. “He has an excellent opportunity to reach out to new residents who are often younger and from diverse backgrounds,” she said.

The party has picked up a state House and state Senate seat in recent years, as St. Cloud has seen an influx in new immigrants, many from East Africa.

District 14A has been under Republican control for more than a decade, and Daisane acknowledges that flipping the seat will be a challenge.

He has raised more than to $78,000 this year, outstripping Perryman’s $20,500. But Perryman started the year with $86,500 in her campaign fund.

Daisane said he is aware of the district’s deep-rooted partisan identity and the potential voter resistance. “There’s fear in seeing a Black, Muslim, immigrant candidate seeking to serve,” he said. “We’re in a ‘red’ district, and many voters might be resistant to voting for a DFL candidate regardless of qualifications or platform.”

Daisane is running on a platform focused on access to opportunity, including affordable housing, health care, child care and education.

“We need urgent improvements in these areas to better serve our community,” he said in a statement.

Perryman, the incumbent, said the key issues voters have raised with her include the rising cost of living, tax increases, and burdensome regulations on schools and small businesses.

“I plan to continue representing every resident in District 14A by reaching out to every community, spending time with them and learning about the issues that are most important to them,” she said.

Community roots

Daisane, 36, is one of six children born to Somali parents. He spent 18 years in a refugee camp in Kenya before immigrating to the U.S. through the United Nations’ refugee program in 2009. He first settled in Omaha, Nebraska, before moving to Minnesota in 2013 to attend St. Cloud State University. He has since earned a bachelor’s degree in international relations and community development and a master’s in public administration from St. Cloud State.

Daisane’s wife, Ayaan Ahmed Aidid, is a poet known in the Somali community for her verses on love, inspiration and peace. Their blended family also includes a son from Daisane’s previous marriage.

Daisane first ran for St. Cloud City Council in 2016, securing 8,026 votes but ultimately falling short.

Immediately after the election, St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis appointed him to serve on the city’s Housing and Redevelopment Authority, work that led him to emphasize affordable housing in his current campaign.

“Having a stable house is the foundation for success,” he said.

In the years after the election, Daisane launched a business, pursued a graduate degree, started a family and also served on the city’s Zoning Board of Appeals and the Downtown Revitalization Task Force.

He recently concluded a one-year stint as a Humphrey School of Public Affairs policy fellow.

University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Daisane is part of a “breakthrough generation” of Somalis running for public office, a group that includes Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and St. Louis Park Mayor Nadia Mohamed, among others.

“Minnesota Somalis are running for state, county, and local offices and winning, widening the voice of the community and their influence,” Jacobs said.

Fatuma Mohamed, a community activist in St. Cloud, praised Daisane’s work during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he coordinated resources for struggling businesses.

She said Daisane is a role model for younger Somalis.

In addition to his political ambitions, Daisane runs Blooming Kids Child Care Center and Daisane Consulting Inc. in St. Cloud.

Operating a child care center in the aftermath of the pandemic presents some of the greatest challenges he has ever faced, Daisane said.

Blooming Kids has received several low-level correction orders from state inspectors, for lacking children’s immunization records, the qualified number of staff, or documentation of staff training, among other issues. All were resolved without further state action.

“Running a child care involves caring for our most precious — our children. I approach this responsibility with the utmost care, and seriousness every day. It’s also generally a challenging industry,” Daisane said.

“Our biggest challenge is staffing. Child care providers often face staff shortages due to the demanding nature of the job, low wages, and lack of benefits. This leads to high turnover rates as employees seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, and makes the day-to-day operations of center-based child care very difficult.”

St. Cloud Times columnist Patrick Henry first met Daisane several years ago at a coffee shop in St. Cloud. Henry described Daisane as having a “big picture” view of a thriving community and a practical understanding of how to achieve that goal.

“Like Paul Wellstone, Daisane takes the hopes and needs of real people seriously,” Henry said. “His policies are grounded in the stories he’s heard and his own experiences of finding a better life, political freedom, and the opportunity to pursue happiness in Minnesota.”

Since launching his bid for state House, Daisane has campaigned several times with Senator Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud, along with DFL House Speaker Melissa Hortman and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy.

His campaign has also drawn support from the AFL-CIO, Rural Caucus DFL, MAPE, and the Climate Cabinet. “The lesson I learned [from my first race] is that resilience and continuous service to the community are crucial,” Daisane said. “My 2016 race motivated me to achieve more for my community, and now I’m more prepared to make an even greater impact.”"
‘Breath of fresh air’: Kamala Harris’ presidential run inspires Minnesota’s South Asian community,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/election-2024/kamala-harris-minnesota-indian-south-asian-voters/,2024-08-26,"Joey Peters, More Joey Peters, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2-11.png,"Sourav Bhunia plans to volunteer for a political campaign for the first time in his life.

The Shoreview resident, who immigrated from India to the United States in 1986, will campaign this year for Vice President Kamala Harris.

The fact that Harris is half-Indian will “probably have a little bit of resonance” in motivating the Indian diaspora to vote this November, he said. Political attacks on Harris’ Indian and Jamaican heritage calling her a diversity candidate will only heighten that, Bhunia said.

“The fact that she is racially out of the mainstream, just like Obama, has a different kind of appeal,” Bhunia said. “It’d be nice if the country was truly colorblind … but we are not, so it’s kind of a breath of fresh air, and something different.”

If sentiments like Bhunia’s carry across the country’s South Asian population, they could have a big impact in November’s presidential election. Indian Americans make up the largest Asian ethnic group in the nation as of 2020, and are emerging as an important voting bloc.

Minnesota is home to a sizable Indian community of about 50,000 people, 60 percent of whom are U.S. citizens through birth or naturalization.

Enthusiasm for Harris was on display at the state Capitol this month at IndiaFest, celebrating India’s independence. Several patrons stopped by a Democratic-Farmer-Labor booth that distributed campaign material for Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

Vishala Pamulaparthy and Madhu Annamraju, who are active with the Minnesota Asian Indian Democratic Association, said their views on abortion rights and immigration align with Harris and Walz.

“Immigration is very much on top of our mind from our community, and that’s something we’ll be looking at in her policies,” Pamulaparthy said. “We are going to be doing door knocks. We want to get voters out. That is going to be critical.”

Political organizers say Harris’ candidacy as the Democratic Party nominee for president is energizing South Asian voters across the country. Harris could become the first woman and Indian American president.

“It is really exciting for folks to be able to see someone who has come from a similar lived experience, a similar background, now a candidate for the highest office in the land,” said Anjuli Cameron.

Cameron, executive director of SEWA-AIFW, a Brooklyn Center-based nonprofit focused on family wellness in South Asian communities, also plans to volunteer for the Harris campaign. Politics run deep in Cameron’s family; she said her grandfather was a freedom fighter in India during its independence movement, which culminated in the country’s independence in 1947.

South Asian voters and voters of color aren’t supporting Harris just because of her ethnicity, Cameron said, but “because her policies align with what is important for those communities, and that’s the difference.” She cited Harris’ views on abortion access, gun control and immigration as issues that resonate with South Asian communities.

Several South Asian community members who spoke to Sahan Journal celebrated the prospect of an Indian American president, and highlighted other factors that will influence them in the upcoming election.

But not all are convinced about voting for Harris.

Asma Zubair, 36, who is Pakistani American, said she and her family are upset with the U.S. government’s funding of Israel’s war against Hamas, which has claimed the lives of about 40,000 people in Gaza, according to the United Nations. The conflict began when Hamas attacked Israel last October, killing more than 1,500 Israelis and kidnapping more than 200 people.

“It’s incredible that there’s a woman running. I was excited when Hillary [Clinton] was running. But [Kamala] has been supporting the genocide,” said Zubair, a Shakopee resident.

Zubair voted for President Joe Biden in the last presidential election, but is disillusioned with Democrats and does not plan to vote this fall.

“If I had to… I would be supporting Trump,” Zubair said. “I don’t support a lot of the things he believes in, but what the government was when he was here, it was good for businesses, the economy was a little bit better. It didn’t feel like we couldn’t afford things.”

An emerging voting bloc

The nation’s South Asian diaspora includes people who trace their heritage to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives and Afghanistan.

Indian American Impact estimates that 36,000 South Asian Minnesotans are eligible to vote. The organization is a liberal-leaning advocacy group based in Washington D.C. that engages South Asians politically.

About 6.2 million people in the United States are of South Asian descent, according to Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact. Approximately 4.4 million South Asians are Indian American, a group that recently surpassed Chinese Americans to become the largest single Asian ethnic group in the country.

About 2.98 million South Asians in the United States are eligible to vote, said Patel, adding that they are a big enough voting bloc to swing battleground states in the presidential election.

“When you look at Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, all of these states have a large enough South Asian American electorate to really be the margin of victory in a race,” Patel said.

For example, he said, Biden won Georgia in 2020 by just 11,000 votes, and eligible South Asian voters in that state number around 103,000.

In the last decade, South Asian representation in elected offices skyrocketed, growing from less than 50 elected people in local, state and federal offices in 2016 to more than 300 today. That includes five members in Congress and Harris’s rise from California attorney general to U.S. senator to vice president.

Minnesota’s contribution to that growth includes Minneapolis City Council members Aisha Chughtai and Aurin Chowdury, Duluth City Council Member Azirin Awal, Eden Prairie City Council Member PG Narayanan, Eden Prairie school board member Debjyoti “DD” Dwivedy and South Washington County Schools board member Simi Patnaik.

Patel estimates that roughly 70 percent of South Asian voters chose Biden in 2020. He said most South Asian voters agree with Democrats on issues like abortion rights, health care and immigration. But he acknowledged that Harris has to work on issues like the Israel-Hamas war, which he said “undoubtedly weighs heavily on the minds of South Asian Americans,” because many are Muslim like most Palestinians.

“The vice president is committed to building trust and actively working to secure the support of all Americans, including on this issue,” he said.

Potential fractures between Harris and South Asian voters don’t end with the Israel-Hamas issue.

Defense attorney Satveer Chaudhary, a former Minnesota state representative and state senator, said most mainstream Democrats approach immigration issues in ways that don’t align with how Indian Americans experience the immigration system. Chaudhary became Minnesota’s first Asian American legislator when he was elected to the House in 1996.

Democratic Party politicians often focus immigration agendas on undocumented immigrants, said Chaudhary, who represented Columbia Heights, Hilltop and parts of Fridley and New Brighton in the state Legislature for 14 years. But many Indian immigrants follow a legal path to immigration, and have spent years — even decades — waiting for a visa.

“They look at the attention that Democrats give to undocumented immigrants versus the long wait and huge expense they went through simply to follow the rules,” he said of Indian immigrants. “There’s some elements that wonder if the Democrats are really on their side.”

Unique immigration issues

Indian immigrants make up Minnesota’s third largest immigrant community at about 30,632, after Mexican and Somali immigrants, according to Minnesota Compass, a data project at Wilder Research.

Indian Americans’ reasons for immigrating to the United States are distinctly different from other immigrant communities, which are often displaced from their home countries due to political strife, Chaudhary said.

“Largely, they come to America through the higher education system, or they already have a fairly high paying job,” he said of Indian immigrants.

Because of these factors, Chaudhary said, Indian Americans are more likely than other immigrants to vote for Republicans because of concerns about issues like high taxes.

Bhunia, a medical device engineer, said he thinks Indian Americans tend to be fiscally conservative. While he agrees with some Republican ideas, he feels the party has “always seemed a bit unwelcoming to immigrants.”

“That strain has always been there,” Bhunia said.

Indian Americans in Minnesota are also more spread out geographically than other immigrant communities, like the large concentrations of Somali residents in south Minneapolis or Hmong residents on St. Paul’s East Side, Chaudhary said.

Many Indian immigrants come to the United States to attend college and then apply for H-1B visas to work here, often in the tech or engineering fields, Chaudhary said. Applications for the H1-B visa have faced big backlogs; more than 400,000 applicants are currently seeking 85,000 visas.

Indian immigrants who come to the United States under an H-1B visa can bring their foreign-born children under the visa, but those same children face deportation when they turn 21 if their parents have not obtained permanent residency. That issue with foreign-born children, sometimes called “documented dreamers,” is the biggest issue facing the community, Chaudhary said.

Neither the Democratic nor Republican party is addressing the matter head on, he added.

Chaudhary helped found the Minnesota Asian Indian Democratic Association in 1994 to organize on issues impacting the community such as discrimination, the dangers of high cholesterol and mental health issues related to pressure from being perceived as “the model minority.”

“It was assumed that because the community did well economically, that [discrimination] wasn’t an issue,” Chaudhary said of mental health issues.

Excitement among non-voters

Chandrika Kalludi, a 22-year-old graduate student at Concordia University, is excited about Harris.

“For an Indian woman to potentially be president, it’s great to hear,” said Kalludi, who moved from India to Minnesota last year to pursue a degree in information technology management. “I’m surprised.”

Kalludi is among the roughly one-third of Indian expats in Minnesota who cannot vote, mostly because of immigration status.

That’s the case for Divya Keshavamurthy, a Burnsville homemaker in her 40s. Keshavamurthy said she’ll be cheering for Harris from the sidelines even though she can’t vote. Keshavamurthy wants to see a woman president, and is “really proud” of Harris’ Indian heritage.

“I don’t vote and a lot of us, for being immigrants, don’t have that opportunity right now,” Keshavamurthy said. “But we’re definitely excited to have somebody represent our country.”

Mohammed Anik, who moved from Bangladesh to Minnesota last year to study pharmacy, wants Harris to win because he believes she will be better on immigration issues. He noted that his uncle has been in the United States for 10 years and is still in the process of becoming a citizen.

Anik, who can’t vote, has been more engaged in the politics of Bangladesh, where protestors ousted the prime minister earlier this month. Working from a cell phone kiosk at the Eden Prairie Center, he glanced through videos of military crackdowns on student protestors in Bangladesh.

Anik said he is not afraid if Trump wins this fall, “because there is freedom in this country and you have the right to talk,” unlike the limited freedom of expression in his home country. However, he’s used to a woman head of state because Bangladesh has had multiple women leaders.

“Woman or man doesn’t matter,” Anik said.

Issues like abortion access and parental leave will persuade Lalita Jyoti to vote for Harris. Jyoti, 36, grew up in the United States and became a citizen eight years ago.

She’s expecting her first child next month, so she’s been thinking about parental leave.

“It’s like six to eight weeks in this country,” she said. “Even dogs get better maternity leave than that.”

Jyoti, who was born in Nepal and is of Nepali-Indian heritage, said she recently found out about Harris’ Indian roots.

“For South Asian people, I’m sure that will be a reason why they go for her,” Jyoti said.

Jyoti said she wants to see a woman president, and that she’s frustrated that female candidates are scrutinized more than their male counterparts. Her husband told her he wasn’t sure Harris was the best candidate to beat Trump “just because she’s a lady,” Jyoti said.

“I don’t know why, for ladies, they’re like, ‘She’s not good enough,’” Jyoti said. “But for men, they don’t say that.”

Tribal leaders weigh in on VP nominee Tim Walz’s commitment to tribal-state relations,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/tribal-leaders-governor-tim-walz-vice-presidential-nominee/,2024-08-22,"Melissa Olson, More Melissa Olson, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/890786-20231009-indigenous-people-sunrise-b3-webp2000.webp,"This story comes to you from MPR News through a partnership with Sahan Journal.

Two weeks have passed since presidential nominee Kamala Harris, the current vice president, chose Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. Leading up to the pick, elected tribal leaders across Minnesota voiced their support of Walz as choice for VP in a letter to the Harris campaign.

Leadership from all 11 tribal nations in the state signed the letter of support, citing Walz’s commitment to tribal-state relations.

President of Lower Sioux Indian Community Robert Larsen signed the letter. He says the biggest change in tribal-state relations over the past several years has been access to decision-makers.

“When it comes to certain things, you’re able to go to the top of the agency,” said Larsen.

Governors going back to Jesse Ventura have issued executive orders affirming the government-to-government relationship. In 2019, Walz issued an order directing all state agencies to consult with tribes.

COVID-19 was a major test of tribal-state relations during the Walz administration. Early in the pandemic, tribal leaders set up a daily phone call with one another to talk about their emergency response.

“The governor, the state, heard about that … and they started going on those calls and subsequently, from that, we have a weekly call. It originally was from the governor’s office. Now it’s the state call with different commissioners on there each week,” said Larsen.

During the pandemic, tribal leaders made response decisions in keeping with their own laws. They decided whether to close schools and businesses or issue their own stay-at-home orders. Tribal leaders also started drafting legislation requiring the state to consult with them on matters affecting tribal nations.

“We pushed that in the Legislature … the state was busy doing their thing with COVID,” said Larsen. “Lo and behold, we got it done. The governor signed it.”

The 2021 law takes the spirit of Walz’s executive order and requires agencies to appoint tribal-state liaisons and mandates state agency employees to attend training.

Red Lake Nation secretary Sam Strong added his name to the letter in support of Walz. Strong says Walz’s choice of White Earth Nation citizen Peggy Flanagan as lieutenant governor has had a big impact on tribal-state relations.

“The most important partnership he ever had was with the lieutenant governor and having her be a voice for tribal nations and voice for the state. Because she doesn’t just represent tribal nations, but she is a tribal nation citizen,” said Strong.

The connection between Walz and Lt. Gov. Flanagan dates to Flanagan’s work training Walz for his first run for Congress. Flanagan worked as a candidate trainer at Camp Wellstone — a program of Wellstone Action, an organization founded by the late Senator Paul Wellstone.

Key legislation, appointments

Tribal leaders say Walz earned their support by passing legislation aimed well-being of Indigenous people, including the restoration of 2 acres of land to the Upper Sioux Community; a bill aimed at removing mascots from Minnesota schools; an education bill that included “Indigenous Education for All”; and others aimed at increasing protections for Indian children and Indigenous people who are murdered or go missing.

The letter also applauds Walz for the “historic number of Native people appointed to key leadership positions.”

This summer, Walz shook up the state’s racetrack commission appointing two former tribal leaders to its ranks. Last year, Walz appointed former tribal chairperson of the Prairie Island Sioux Community to the commission tasked with redesigning the state flag.

In 2022, Walz appointed attorney Tadd Johnson to the University of Minnesota Board of Regents, the first Native American to be appointed to the board since it was established more than a century and a half ago.

‘Moments of disagreement and difference’

The letter of support for Walz also pointed to “moments of disagreement and difference.”

The letter is silent on tribal nations’ opposition to the reconstruction of Enbridge’s Line 3.

Enbridge operates six pipelines carrying millions of barrels of Canadian oil across the northern part of the state. The network of pipelines crosses waterways full of wild rice, a dietary and cultural mainstay of Ojibwe life.

White Earth Nation chair Michael Fairbanks opposed the pipeline.

“We did what we could with our legal department and exhausted everything we could to halt this project coming through northern Minnesota,” said Fairbanks.

The pipeline passes just north of White Earth Nation’s lands.

“I feel like there could have been something little more that could have been done to halt this pipeline,” said Fairbanks.

According to previous MPR News reporting, Walz maintained it was not his role to stay permits for Line 3.

Larsen says despite differences, Walz has been a good partner.

“The tribes can be as big or a bigger ally than they’ve been an opponent, and I believe this administration has heard that, understood it and worked with us,” he said.

Last year, Walz became the first governor in state history to visit all 11 tribal nations."

Hosted August 15 at the Wellstone Center in St. Paul, the community conversation brought together a political scientist, a voting-rights expert, a Duluth city councilor, and Minnesota advocates for both the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and the Republican Party. Sahan Journal reporters Joey Peters and Katelyn Vue hosted the event, which was also live streamed and recorded for air on Minnesota Public Radio News.

For Democrats, the sudden switch at the top of the ticket from President Joe Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris has excited progressive voters in Minnesota and across the country, said consumer protection attorney and DFL-leaning political analyst Abou Amara. The recent addition of Governor Tim Walz as Harris’ running mate underlined that change for Minnesotans, he said.

“Progressives had been a bit depressed,” Amara said. “The change at the top of the ticket with Kamala Harris has really galvanized people.”

An indicator of this, Amara suggested, was the boost in primary turnout this election cycle for Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, compared to two years ago. To Amara, Omar’s bigger margin of victory in 2024 shows “some level of increased intensity within the progressive coalition.”

Some Black men find a positive message in the Republican Party

AK Kamara, who is one of two Republican National Committee members for Minnesota, described a similar spike in enthusiasm for the Republican Party. Kamara pointed to the U.S. Senate race and the party endorsement and primary victory for Royce White: a former college basketball standout who is Black.

“For him to win the plurality of that vote shows that people in the Republican Party are not maybe the way people frame it,” Kamara said, “as in, ‘You’re racist or xenophobic,’ or something like that.”

White’s victory pointed to the growth of the populist wing of the Republican Party, Kamara said, and also the changing dynamics of conservative voters.

“You’re starting to see a lot more Black males get involved in the Republican Party,” he said.

Immigration policy divides Minnesota voters – and immigrant communities, too

Kamara argued for the Republican position on immigration, which he said should favor U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. He noted that his father immigrated to the United States legally in 1979, and said he understands why some people fleeing a bad situation in their home country come here illegally.

But Kamara argued that the government must enforce federal immigration laws, and that the country ultimately should use its finite resources on benefits for its own citizens.

Former president Trump has pledged to deport undocumented residents: a population of almost 80,000 people in Minnesota. “It’s very simple: If you are a legal immigrant, you have nothing to fear,” Kamara said. “If you are not here legally, I think self-deportation is probably your best option.”

Amara credited Kamara for being “honest and transparent” about Republican Party positions, but argued that most Minnesota voters don’t agree with them.

“I would argue that’s why they have not won a statewide race since 2006,” Amara said. “They continue to lose at the ballot box. Minnesotans continue to reject those ideas.”

The war in Gaza continues to trouble some Minnesota voters

National polling suggests that progressive voters are more enthusiastic about Harris’ candidacy than they were about Biden’s reelection. Yet Duluth City Councilor Azirin Awal states that many Minnesotans – and Muslims in particular — remain uncertain over Harris’ to-be-determined stance on Israel’s war against Hamas.

Awal said she voted uncommitted during the March presidential primary over the issue: The uncommitted campaign drew 46,000 votes in Minnesota. She said she’s now waiting to hear what Harris’ plan will be. While Harris’ rhetoric has been “more empathetic to the Palestinian cause,” uncommitted voters need “not just words, we need actions,” Awal said.

“We are hearing from international courts that what is happening is not OK, and yet we are continuing to enable a genocide,” Awal said. “We’re continuing to enable vast human rights violations and tremendous loss of life, loss of youth. So I am struggling quite a bit.”

Are voters of color motivated by ‘historic firsts’?

The prospect of Harris becoming the first woman and first South Asian president will likely motivate Democratic Party base voters to turn out this fall, said University of Minnesota professor of political science Michael Minta.

“Harris is way ahead in polls for enthusiasm for minorities, young people, women — and that’s usually what happens when you have one of these historical firsts,” Minta said. “This is what the Democrats wanted, and it seems to be working.”

Michelle Witte, executive director of League of Women Voters of Minnesota, addressed the rights voters in Minnesota have to get out to the polls, or even stay home in some cases. Witte referred to a law in Minnesota that allows all voters to register only once to receive mail-in ballots to all future elections.

“If you don’t want to go to the polls, you can have a permanent absentee ballot sent home to you,” Witte said.

She also praised recently passed voting laws in Minnesota, such as one that allows felons who just ended prison sentences to vote, even if they’re on probation; pre-voter registration for 16- and 17-year-olds; and automatic voter registration at the DMV.

“We’re a very amazing state for voters,” Witte said.

Many protesters wore red shirts that read “Minnesota divest from genocide!” and keffiyehs. During the meeting, they held up signs with the faces, names, and ages of children, labeled “Killed by Israel” or “Injured by Israel.”

Walz, the chair of the four-member State Board of Investment, did not attend the meeting. He had campaign stops scheduled Wednesday in Colorado and Massachusetts. State Auditor Julie Blaha chaired the meeting in his absence.

During the public comment period, 16 of 18 speakers spoke in support of divestment. Many were public employees who said they did not want their pensions invested in these funds.

Stacey Gurian-Sherman, a 67-year-old Minneapolis resident and former public employee who described herself as an “unapologetic anti-Zionist Jew,” said it was painful to see the violence in Gaza happening in her name. She described United Nations reports detailing torture of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.

“We must not condone in Israel what we vehemently condemn in other countries,” she said. “To know this is going on and not use your authority to stop it is weird.”

The Minnesota State Board of Investment has four members: the governor, who serves as chair; the state auditor, Blaha; the secretary of state, Steve Simon; and the attorney general, Keith Ellison. The board is responsible for managing $146 billion in state assets, including pensions for the three state retirement systems.

Of that amount, the Anti-War Committee, a Minneapolis-based group organizing against various wars since 1998, has identified $119 million that they say is invested in Israeli companies and government bonds, as well as an additional $4 billion in companies “that are complicit in or profiting from Israel’s apartheid and genocide,” said Meredith Aby, a committee spokesperson.

Blaha, the state auditor, has emphasized her role on the board as a fiduciary, responsible for stewarding pensions, not making political statements.

But the board has chosen to divest in the past, including a 1985 divestment from South Africa and Namibia, and a 1998 vote to divest from companies that obtain more than 15% of their profits from consumer tobacco products. On other occasions, the board has divested from foreign countries based on directives from the Legislature, including Sudan, Iran, Russia, and Belarus. Those legislative directives all included clauses that allow the president of the United States to overrule the law if he or she deems it to conflict with U.S. foreign policy.

During Wednesday’s meeting, protesters unfurled banners with messages like “Walz: want support? Stop genocide.” They asked the state leaders to stand for a moment of silence for Palestinians who had lost their lives. When Blaha, Ellison, and Simon did not stand, protesters condemned them.

“Shame that you stayed seated!” one of the protesters shouted. “You work for us!”

Ethan Roberts, deputy executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, described Wednesday’s meeting as “particularly brutal,” noting that one protester had shouted, “[Expletive] Israel,” and others had appeared to target Simon, who is Jewish.

“The Boycott, Divest, Sanctions movement is premised on Israel’s destruction,” Roberts said. “It’s a form of economic warfare which will not succeed.”

As the meeting took place, Israel was bracing for a possible retaliatory attack from Iran, he noted. Iran has threatened to respond to the killing of a senior Hamas official in Tehran on July 31.

“The only way Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Druze Israelis are going to survive that, are the very weapons systems that these activists are targeting,” he said.

Though Walz’s national profile is recent, the divestment campaign against the State Board of Investment is not. The Anti-War Committee has been organizing protests demanding divestment from Israel since 2019. Efforts have ramped up since the militant group Hamas attacked Israel last October 7, killing more than 1,100 Israelis and capturing 240 hostages. Since then, Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has resulted in nearly 40,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

As part of the divestment campaign, organizers said they had asked Walz to meet with Gazan families. The meeting was scheduled for July 9. But it was abruptly canceled when the governor’s staff learned that they hoped to discuss state divestment, they said.

Staff explained that Walz was prepared to hear stories, but not to discuss divestment or other policy demands, said Sana Wazwaz, a Palestinian organizer.

“It was a slap in the face,” said Wazwaz. “It was a clear sign of disrespect, and it was a signal from Governor Walz that he does not view the Palestinian community as legitimate partners in effecting policy change.”

Walz’s office did not respond to a Sahan Journal request to confirm the scheduling of this meeting or clarify why it was canceled.

Wazwaz said she wanted to see Walz calling for divestment, an arms embargo of Israel, and a permanent and immediate ceasefire.

In a press conference after the investment board meeting, Palestinian activist Taher Herzallah, who is running for Anoka County Commissioner, condemned Walz.

“You have a man like Governor Walz who’s being portrayed as the nice Midwest dad, the one who’s going to give everyone bear hugs in America, refusing to move, not a foot, but not even a single inch, towards correcting the injustice committed against the Palestinian people — something that he has control over here,” Herzallah said.

Building bridges?

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate, Walz, have enjoyed a surge in the polls since they abruptly emerged at the top of the ticket this summer. But cracks in her support have started to show. Last week in Michigan, leaders of the Uncommitted National Movement said they approached Kamala Harris before a rally and requested a meeting to discuss an arms embargo of Israel. Then, pro-Palestinian protesters unaffiliated with the Uncommitted movement interrupted her speech later that night.

Harris, whose presidential campaign is less than a month old, has yet to release a detailed policy platform on Israel or other issues. She has taken a different tone from President Joe Biden verbally, expressing empathy over Palestinian suffering. She has urged a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages. After an Israeli airstrike in Gaza over the weekend, she said that once again, “far too many” civilians had been killed. But after the Michigan rally, her national security adviser, Phil Gordon, tweeted that Harris did not support an arms embargo of Israel.

Asma Mohammed, the lead organizer of Uncommitted Minnesota, said she expected Harris to unveil her platform next week during the Democratic National Convention. Though Mohammed does not expect Harris’ platform to include an arms embargo, she hopes it will include a cease-fire plan. She also said that Harris had agreed to meet with her colleagues in Michigan, who are waiting for a date. The Harris campaign has not publicly confirmed whether the vice president committed to a meeting with the organizers in Michigan.

When Harris named Walz as her running mate, the pick garnered praise both from Minnesota’s Jewish leaders and the Uncommitted Movement. The Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas released a statement praising Walz’s “stalwart friendship with Israel” and noted he had “spoken forcefully in support of Israel and against antisemitism.”

Activists from the Uncommitted Movement, too, spoke in support of Harris’ choice, pointing to Walz’s comments in March when 19% of the voters in Minnesota’s Democratic presidential primary marked their ballots “uncommitted” instead of voting for Biden, in protest of his support of Israel.

“We start bringing these folks back in, we listen to what they’re saying,” he said on CNN about Minnesota’s uncommitted voters. “Their message is clear that they think this is an intolerable situation and that we can do more.”

Mohammed, who has worked with Walz on policy bills and served on state committees, said that she’d seen indications from Harris and Walz that they were more open to listening than Biden. And she noted she had seen Walz evolve on other issues in the past.

“I think he is willing to change on issues that are winnable,” she said. “But do I think that has been the case with Israel and Palestine? No.”

She pointed to her appointment, and subsequent removal from, a working group to identify educational resources and provide model lesson plans on the Holocaust and other genocides. She hoped to represent Muslim voices in the working group, to speak not only for Palestine but for Bosnia, the Uyghurs in China, and forcible displacement of Muslims in India. But after naming her to the group, the Minnesota Department of Education removed her, declining to specify who had made the decision. The agency then paused next steps on the working group after pushback to Mohammed’s removal.

No matter the result of the presidential election, Walz will remain Minnesota’s governor for at least a few more months. In his capacity as governor, Mohammed said she would like to see Walz support efforts to divest Minnesota from Israel and make sure the Palestinian community has a say on the genocide education working group.

But she also said she’d like to see him play a role on the national stage, inviting in voices of voters in the pro-Palestine Uncommitted Movement. Harris’ promise of a meeting gave Muslim voters hope, Mohammed said. Walz could do something similar. Without a policy shift on Gaza, she said, it would be difficult to motivate Muslim voters to turn out for Democrats.

“I hope that Governor Walz takes this opportunity to be a bridge between uncommitted voters in Minnesota and the Harris-Walz campaign, because right now, I think we’re still feeling really disconnected,” she said.

She noted that in many ways, voters in the Uncommitted movement want the same outcome as Walz.

“We are all trying to defeat the fascists in November,” she said. “We need to be on this together.”"

Hiltsley won 51.28% of the votes in the primary for District 38A, a traditional DFL stronghold, while Wynfred Russell received 48.72% of the votes. Results released by the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office showed Hiltsley with 1,005 votes and Russell with 955

“This is just a step, the big picture is November,” said Hiltsley, after the results were announced. Although the district's history makes it almost certain she will win the general election, Hiltsley wants to make sure there is a big turnout across the ballot in November. .

At MC’s Tap House, where Hiltsley was holding a watch party, the crowd greeted and cheered when they realized Hiltsley won the race. The crowd chanted Huldah’s name and her slogan, “Stronger Together.”



“I told myself regardless of what was gonna happen tonight, it was gonna be the same speech of gratitude,” said Hiltsley after results were announced. She went across the room to thank members of her team, volunteers who went door knocking during the campaign, data managers, and her family.

Hiltsley raised $31,200 for her campaign, twice as much as Russell, according to the last report she provided the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board.

Their primary battle developed after Representative Michael Nelson announced his retirement last January, opening a path for new candidates in the north metro district that has become home to a growing number of African immigrants in the last two decades.

District 38A, which was redistricted in 2020, is home to diverse immigrant communities. It is estimated that only 38% of the population is white, while 33% of the inhabitants are Black, 18% are Asian, and 9% are Hispanic, according to 2022 U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Brad Olson won the Republican primary for District 38A, with nearly 90% of the votes, against Yelena S. Kurdyumova, who earned 10% of the votes. Results showed Olson with 566 votes and Kurdyumova with 64 votes.

Brooklyn Park Mayor Hollies Winston endorsed Hiltsley’s campaign and attended the party on Tuesday. “I am so proud, I am so relieved,” he said.

Four tables of the restaurant were full of supporters and volunteers, and the room kept filling before the results were announced.

“We want to have somebody in this seat who can resonate with us, that knows our struggle, knows our story,” said Fartun Nur, who has lived in Brooklyn Park for more than 20 years.

At his watch party at the Organization of Liberians in Minnesota, Russell addressed about a dozen supporters after results showed him trailing Hiltsley by 47 votes, or 2.4%.

""The process is not over yet,"" he said.

His campaign plans to look into the process for an automatic recount. Former mayor Lisa Jacobson, who attended the party and endorsed Russell’s campaign, repeatedly reminded supporters that she won her race by just one vote.

Russell, 52, had represented residents of Brooklyn Park on the City Council from 2019 to 2022, before running against Winston for mayor. He also founded the African Career Education and Resources (ACER) and has a background in public health.

Before the results came in, Binta Barry-Toe, a Brooklyn Center resident, praised Russell’s work for the Liberian community during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“He’s a Liberian,” she said. “He’s been in this community for 20 years plus, and has influenced the community positively by advocating for all rights.”

Jamal Said, candidate at the Brooklyn Park City Council supported Hiltsley in this race.

“She knows about our issues; she knows the culture of a lot of people,” he said. ""She has been at the forefront of a lot of local fights. She is the kind of person who will take those issues to the state.""

Hiltsley, a 39-year-old Kenyan born data privacy manager, aims to bring her experience in the corporate and nonprofit sectors to her work in the Legislature. She campaigned to create an environment where all district residents can thrive.

Besides Winston, she was endorsed by the Minnesota DFL Progressive Caucus, and several current DFL legislators.

She said those endorsements “show that I’m ready to go to the Capitol and actually be able to be productive on Day One.”

Just as when she ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate two years ago, Hiltsley said her family legacy was what inspired her run for public office.

“We fought the immigration system for 11 long years, my dad and my mom did,” she said. Hiltsley and her family came to the United States from Kenya in 1995, and risked deportation before Senator Paul Wellstone pleaded their case.

“It finally clicked when good people run, lives are changed for the better.”"
Rep. Ilhan Omar defeats Don Samuels in Fifth District primary by wide margin,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/primary-results-ilhan-omar-don-samuels-minnesota/,2024-08-12,"Joey Peters, Katelyn Vue, Alfonzo Galvan, Cynthia Tu, More Joey Peters, More Katelyn Vue, More Alfonzo Galvan, More Cynthia Tu, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/OmarWatchParty-5262.jpg,"Congresswoman Ilhan Omar beat former Minneapolis City Council Member Don Samuels in Tuesday’s primary election, clinching the Democratic-Farmer-Labor nomination to run for reelection in November. It’s the second time Omar has defeated Samuels in a primary for the Fifth Congressional District.

Omar will advance as the Democratic candidate in the November 5 general election, and is a heavy favorite to win reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives. The district, which includes Minneapolis and some surrounding suburbs, last elected a Republican in 1960.

""Tonight's victory belongs to our incredible campaign staff. It belongs to the incredible volunteers, our elected leaders, and it certainly belongs to the voters,"" Omar said as a packed crowd looked on at her watch party. ""We run the politics of joy.""

Omar is running for her fourth term, and will face journalist and activist Dalia Al-Aqidi, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary.

Omar received 56 percent of the vote, beating Samuels by 13 percentage points.

Omar and her supporters described the win as ""joyful."" Omar thanked her supporters and her husband and children.

She called Samuels’ campaign against her the ""ugliest"" and ""most disgusting"" campaign she has ever faced. Omar said her family members, including her husband, were targeted by Samuels’ campaign. She also said Samuels focused on hateful messaging.

Hennepin County Commissioner Angela Conley said Omar won the primary in a ""blowout."" As a congresswoman, she said, Omar has a track record of knowing what people in her district care about.

""That's why we're amplifying a message of joy, because we are joyful,"" Conley said.

Surrounded by family, staff and supporters, Samuels conceded the race to Omar around 10 p.m.

""Even tonight, on this tragic loss, I have a deep sense of gratitude to have been afforded the privilege to have participated in the American democratic process in an effort to make our union more perfect, to make our district more well served, to hear the voice of the unheard, to amplify the voices of the muted, to go to places where people feel neglected and let them know they are seen and heard,” Samuels said. “It is a privilege that I cannot put a value on.”

He thanked his supporters and donors, and said their work would live on.

Samuels added that he is open to running for public office again.

""I think we make decisions based on a combination of our capacity and our compassions to the realities around us,” he said, “and I have the energy.”

Last-minute stumping, a hopeful Samuels

Earlier in the evening, Omar talked to voters outside of the Target store in Minneapolis’ Dinkytown. Omar posed for selfies with passersby and answered questions about her campaign.

She told reporters that her campaign was working hard to remind voters of the primary election, adding that low turnout two years ago led to her close race with Samuels.

“Most of the voters that we’re talking to already know why they’re voting for me,” Omar said. “They know that I’ve worked tirelessly on their behalf and I’ve been their champion. And they know Don is somebody who’s been in office and does not have a single thing he can campaign on. The only thing he’s campaigning on is he hates me.”

Later in the evening, about 100 people gathered at a restaurant on Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis for Omar’s watch party.

Murwo Elmi, 37, said she has known Omar for the past six years, and supports her because of her stance on several issues, including human rights and the Israel-Hamas war. Omar is “advocating for people who need help,” Elmi said.

Nearly 50 people gathered at the Hilton Canopy hotel in Downtown Minneapolis for Samuels’ watch party, cheering as he walked in.

Samuels said he was exhausted, and that he had been up since 7 a.m. on the last day of his nine-month campaign.

Before the final results had been tallied, his campaign manager, Joe Radinovich, said Samuels’ win was “conceivable.” Since Samuels’ 2022 defeat, Radinovich said, the campaign has focused its efforts on suburban voters and the East African community.

“Everybody on the team, including Don, has given everything we can,” Radinovich said.

While waiting for the results, Samuels said he was confident that those voting blocks could be the deciding factors in his race against Omar.

“Everybody came to realize that their contribution could be simply significant and potentially become the winning factor,” Samuels said.

Long-time supporter and friend, Paula Cole, said many of her friends weren’t aware there was a primary election Tuesday. She believes the results from the primary could be more impactful than the presidential election.

“I don’t have anything against [Omar] per se, but I think she lacks that honesty and integrity,” Cole said.

Omar rocketed to fame in 2016 after becoming the nation’s first elected Somali in a state legislative seat when she won a term in the Minnesota House of Representatives. Two years later, her fame catapulted as she was elected to Congress and became a member of The Squad, an informal group of progressive Congressmembers.

Two members of the Squad — New York’s Jamaal Bowman and Missouri’s Cori Bush — recently lost reelection to more moderate challengers with strong financial backing from pro-Israel groups.

Samuels, who criticized Omar over her previous votes against funding Israel’s military, failed at replicating those results. His candidacy did not attract the same funding from pro-Israel groups as the successful challengers to Bowman and Bush.

Samuels, who represented a north Minneapolis ward on the City Council for 11 years, came within 2 percentage points of beating Omar in 2022. He ran as a pragmatic alternative to Omar’s progressivism and has criticized her for what he calls bad constituent services in lieu of chasing national fame.

“She’s a purist,” Samuels said in an interview before the primary. “So what happens then is everybody else is compromising to get things done, being pragmatic, and she stays pure and gets a fan base all around the country of people who admire people who speak truth to power and never compromise.”

Omar campaigned on her legislative accomplishments, including bringing more than $54 million of federal money for community projects to the district, and authoring and passing the MEALS Act, which Omar says fed more than 30 million children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Omar dismissed Samuels’ campaign as reactionary.

“It is a campaign basically designed on hateful rhetoric of anti-somebody instead of the joyful campaign we’re running that is for something,” she said before Tuesday’s election.

Omar raised nearly five times as much money as Samuels, according to campaign finance reports. Omar raised $6.7 million, more than double the amount she raised in 2022. Samuels raised $1.4 million."
Rematch: Rep. Ilhan Omar and Don Samuels vie for Fifth District in primary election,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/ilhan-omar-don-samuels-primary-election-minneapolis-minnesota-2024/,2024-08-10,"Joey Peters, More Joey Peters, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1-3.png,"U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar and former Minneapolis City Council Member Don Samuels are once again vying for victory in the Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary after facing off in the same race two years ago, where Omar squeaked out an unexpectedly close win.

Omar is campaigning on her legislative accomplishments and promise to continue serving as a progressive voice in Congress. Samuels is framing himself as a pragmatic alternative, maintaining that he’ll compromise on issues and be more present in the district.

The election takes place on Tuesday, August 13, and early voting is already under way.

Omar is running for her fourth term representing the Fifth Congressional District encompassing Minneapolis and some of its suburbs. She previously served one term in the Minnesota House of Representatives, where she rocketed to national fame after becoming the first Somali state legislator elected in the country.

Samuels, who served 11 years on the Minneapolis City Council and four years on the school board, is making a second run for the congressional seat.

Omar is one of the most recognizable progressive members of Congress, known as part of “The Squad,” which includes Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, and others. Samuels, who represented the North Side on the City Council, has turned that exposure and reputation into a campaign issue, painting Omar as a politician more concerned about her national image than representing constituents at home.

Samuels has said if elected, he’ll continue to live in the north Minneapolis home where he and his wife, Sondra Samuels, raised their four children.

“I stay with my community,” Samuels said, citing his public service experience. “I’m going to continue to live here. I’m going to continue to have multiple town hall meetings. I’m going to consider every single phone call from a constituent to be an accumulation of the wisdom of the community and what its needs are.”

Omar painted Samuels’ candidacy as reactionary and negative.

“It is a campaign basically designed on hateful rhetoric of anti-somebody instead of the joyful campaign we’re running that is for something,” Omar said.

Although Samuels, a Jamaican immigrant, has a reputation for being pro-police, he and Omar, a Somali immigrant, share largely similar views on key issues, including immigration and abortion rights. They also support police reform efforts like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would crack down on racial profiling by police, and the Amir Locke No-Knock Warrants Act, which Omar authored.

Samuels acknowledged that he and Omar have similar policy platforms. But he contends that many of Omar’s votes in Congress are unpopular with the district and most Congressional Democrats. He said her past votes against bills like the $1 trillion infrastructure plan in 2021 were out of touch. Omar and a block of progressives voted against infrastructure as a protest over President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan not coming up to vote first.

He also criticized Omar for past votes against U.S. funding of the Israeli military.

“She takes exceptional votes and isolates our district as an outlier, so we won’t get the support we need when the time comes,” Samuels said. “She’s a purist. So what happens then is everybody else is compromising to get things done, being pragmatic, and she stays pure and gets a fan base all around the country of people who admire people who speak truth to power and never compromise.”

Samuels also argued that he would be more effective in Congress by working on issues like crime with local officeholders like Mayor Jacob Frey, who has clashed with Omar in the past.

Omar, however, emphasized that her votes and approach have gained her institutional and popular support in the district.

“As the person carrying the DFL endorsement, I would say my policies, my votes and judgments, have been in alignment with the people that I represent,” she said.

She portrayed her bill to cancel student debt as having a practical impact by leading to President Joe Biden’s executive order on student debt relief. Although the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Biden’s order, Omar said the issue is now in the mainstream consciousness, and that she hopes to pass her bill in Congress.

She defended her previous votes against U.S. funding of Israel’s military.

“I do believe that it is important for us to stop funding Israel’s military until they stop the occupation and the death and destruction of Palestinians,” Omar said.

Samuels said he supports funding Israel’s military. Both campaigns say they support a ceasefire in Israel’s war against Hamas, which started last fall after Hamas killed more than 1,000 people in Israel and kidnapped a few hundred more. Israel’s attacks in Gaza have killed more than 39,000 people, including women and children.

Omar’s campaign said some of her key accomplishments in Congress include bringing more than $54 million of federal money for community projects to the district, and authoring and passing the MEALS Act, which Omar says fed more than 30 million children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Omar defended her constituent services; her campaign cites 91 town hall meetings, 7,000 constituent meetings and more than 3,600 constituent cases that her office worked on in 2023.

Samuels has occasionally come under fire for his messaging style, most recently in a TV ad that portrayed Omar as “missing” from the district.

The ad drew condemnation from Omar’s campaign and several local activists, who said the messaging was disrespectful to the issue of missing Black and Indigenous women locally and nationwide. Samuels’ campaign refused to take down the ad.

A close race in 2022

Samuels came within 2 percentage points of beating Omar in the 2022 primary, losing by roughly 2,500 votes.

During that election cycle, Samuels hammered Omar for her support for a failed 2021 Minneapolis ballot measure that would have abolished the Minneapolis Police Department and replaced it with a new public safety department that would have included social workers as well as police officers.

Samuels was a lead plaintiff in lawsuits to prevent the 2021 public safety measure from getting on the ballot.

Omar said the race was close because she was focused on using her resources to support other Democrats who were running for election in the state, including Governor Tim Walz, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and several legislative candidates. Walz was reelected that year, and the DFL defended its majority in the state House of Representatives and gained control of the state Senate, paving the way for a DFL trifecta.

“We did not want to waste a lot of resources in that primary, so we did not run a robust campaign,” Omar said.

But because this year is a presidential election, Minnesota Democrats have a lot of resources to defend the trifecta, she said.

“We can focus all our resources in making sure we organize like we know how to,” Omar said of her primary campaign.

In this year’s race, Omar has raised nearly five times as much money as Samuels, according to campaign finance reports. Omar has $6.7 million as of press time, more than double the amount she raised in 2022.

Omar also has the endorsement of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and key state officials like Ellison and U.S. Senator Tina Smith. She recently attracted the support of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who headed a rally for her in Minnesota.

Samuels, who has raised $1.4 million as of press time, is endorsed by three former DFL state party chairs, including former Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch. He maintained that he’s building on the momentum from his 2022 campaign, going from 100 volunteers two years ago to 1,200 volunteers this year."

By the day of the primary, on August 13, data security manager Huldah Hiltsley hopes to knock on thousands of doors of potential voters in Brooklyn Park and Osseo. And so does the team of nonprofit executive Wynfred Russell, her opponent in the DFL race for House District 38A.

Their primary battle comes after Representative Michael Nelson announced his retirement last January, opening a path for new candidates in the north metro district that has been home to a growing number of African immigrants in the last two decades.

RELATED STORIES Here’s what you need to know about voting in the Minnesota primary

At the DFL endorsing convention in April, both Hiltsley and Russell won a round but neither was able to secure the 60% threshold for an endorsement, leading to the primary challenge.

District 38A, which was redistricted in 2020, is home to diverse immigrant communities. It is estimated that only 38% of the population is white, while 33% of the inhabitants are black, 18% are Asian, and 9% are Hispanic, according to 2022 U.S. Census Bureau numbers.

When Russell, 52, was elected at the Brooklyn Park City Council in 2019, he was the first African immigrant on the Council.

“We have knocked the glass ceiling,” said Russell, who is Liberian American. “I am glad and I am proud of the work we have done over the years.”

“Now we are a minority-majority city,” Russell added. “So we need someone to represent us, who understands these different cultural dynamics.”

Hiltsley, 39, witnessed the demographic change in the area with arrival of new immigrant communities and said she is honored to be part of this legacy.

“But at the same time, we have a long way to go,” she said, pointing out she would be the only legislator of Kenyan heritage, if elected.

Two Republicans, Yelena Kurdyumova and Brad Olson, will also face off in Tuesday’s primary. Neither responded to a request for comment ahead of the primary.

The candidate who wins the DFL primary will most likely represent the district, which has been a Democratic stronghold for more than 20 years.

Key issues both DFL candidates want to address include public safety, health, education, housing and economic growth.

Huldah Hiltsley

On a weekend door-knocking session, Hiltsley paid a visit to Peggy Darrett-Brewer, 62, a Brooklyn Park resident who has had issues related to trash collection with the company managing her block. Hilstley came with updates after their first conversation: one City Council member wanted to talk with Darrett-Brewer about it.

This is a city issue, but Hiltsley said it is also something she could take up as a state legislator. Property management companies could be held accountable and solutions could be found in community engagement programs.

“It kind of clicked for me,” Hiltsley told Darrett-Brewer, of her conversations on the issue. “There are neighborhoods where I have door-knocked where a simple thing as initiating a youth program, where they get a little stipend, they come in here and clean up the neighborhood.”

Community safety is also an issue that has come up during her door-knocking.

The community has to be at the center of that conversation, Hiltsley said. The local police chief wants to work with “violence interrupters” in the community during interventions. But he needs resources to help fund the program — which the Legislature could provide.

One of Hiltsley’s priorities is to provide more arts, sports and educational opportunities for young people. State funds could help renovate community centers and boost programming. That’s another way to keep young people engaged and less likely to seek out high-risk activities, she said.

Hiltsley said she would bring her experience as a privacy and data security manager and her background launching a nonprofit, SaniNAps, which addresses the lack of sanitary towels and school supplies in Kenya, to her work in the Legislature.

She says her experience is rooted in community and she wants to create an environment where all district residents can thrive. This motto guided her campaign for Senate in 2022. Although she did not win that race, Hiltsley says she gained experience that helped in this year’s campaign.

“We have built a great network, we built a great support system,” she said. The volunteers who worked with her on the race for Senate joined her to form a new team.

This year Hiltsley is targeting a larger group of primary voters, especially strong and leaning Democrats who have voted in previous primaries, instead of putting resources exclusively on voter education and outreach to underrepresented communities.

So far her campaign has raised more than $31,200 and she has spent around $21,100, according to the last report she provided the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board.

After the 2022 Senate race, Hiltsley and her team helped support other candidates across Minnesota, building new relationships. She has been endorsed by the Minnesota DFL Progressive Caucus, Brooklyn Park Mayor Hollies Winston and several current DFL legislators.

She said those endorsements “show that I’m ready to go to the Capitol and actually be able to be productive on Day One.”

Since her last campaign, what keeps Hiltsley going has not changed either. Her family legacy and history have been a source of motivation for her to run.

“We fought the immigration system for 11 long years, my dad and my mom did,” she said. Hiltsley and her family came to the United States from Kenya in 1995, and risked deportation before Senator Paul Wellstone pleaded for their case.

“It finally clicked that politics, and when good people run, lives are changed for the better.”

Wynfred Russell

On the last day of the weekend long celebration for Liberian independence, Russell and his team visited the Liberian community at a family gathering. Alvin Cummings, 49, lives in the district and came to the event with his wife and his kids. He plans to put one of Russell’s flyers on display at his barber shop.

“Last time at the City Council, I saw what he stands for,” said Cummings.

Before running for the Minnesota House, Russell served one term on the Brooklyn Park’s City Council from 2019 to 2022 before running against Winston, the current mayor.

“I come to this position as a legislator,” said Russell. “I come to this position with a lot of experience working on the Brooklyn Park City Council, hiring the police chief, for example.”

To tackle issues of public safety, Russell hopes to put resources in hiring mental health specialists who would be part of police response teams in the area. He also wants to ensure that the police work closely with the community.

Russell relies on the experience he gained not only at the City Council, where he worked on the city’s COVID-19 response and served on the city’s Human Rights Commission, but also on his work as an advocate. He is the founder of African Career Education and Resources (ACER) and has a background in public health.

“I’ve learned that, once you get there, how do you put forth legislation? You have to build relationships,” said Russell. “No matter how passionate you may be about a certain issue, you will not be able to get it through if you don’t have the support, the sort of bipartisan support working with different groups and bringing them on board.”

For Russell, this campaign is different from the ones he has run previously. It is a partisan campaign and the issues he is targeting are larger. In the Legislature, he hopes to be able to tackle issues such as increasing funding for K-12 and higher education.

Running for the House is also a matter of representation.

“If you look at the Minnesota House, there are a lot of folks who are from East Africa, a lot of Asian, Hmong, African Americans, but very few West Africans,” Russell said. “We need our voice at the table.”

So far, Russell’s campaign has raised more that $15,900 and he has spent around $14,800, according to the last report he provided the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board.

For his campaign, Russell has a team of volunteers helping him door-knock and reach out to voters.

The team also involves high schoolers from the community. Before the door-knocking sessions, campaign manager Frances Tyler gives them the elevator speech: Wynfred Russell is running for the House and they want the person’s vote for the primary.

“It’s very important to me because that’s how I started, I see myself in these young people,” said Russell, who got involved in politics at his school, when he was elected to the student government.

Russell comes from a politically active family: his mother was a teacher and his father a community organizer. At 9 years old, Russell came to the United States as a refugee. He was brought from a camp in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to Michigan by a humanitarian worker.

“I’ve never forgotten the kind gesture and support that they showed me,” he said. “And I’ve always thought that the way to give back, [was] to embark in a career of public service.”"
"For Minnesota’s growing Venezuelan community, disputed election sparks worry, hope",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/venezuela-presidential-election-minnesota-protest/,2024-08-07,"Elza Goffaux, More Elza Goffaux, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/VenezuelaRally_002.jpg,"As protests heated up in Venezuela following the disputed presidential election, artist and activist Sheila Colmenares joined several hundred fellow expatriates at the Minnesota Capitol.

The tools of her protest: a book and a suitcase. The character she embodied was waiting for a train. In her play “Riel Adentro,” Colmenares tells the story of Latin Americans, especially Venezuelans, who emigrate.

More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled the country’s political and economic turmoil in recent years. Their numbers have grown rapidly in Minnesota, from nearly 400 to 2,600 in a decade. After the disputed July 28 election, those numbers could grow further.

The election has left the country on the brink of a crisis, after President Nicolás Maduro declared victory. Opposition leaders, who obtained voting tallies after the polls closed, said they had defeated Maduro by a 2-to-1 margin.

In the protests and government crackdown following the vote, at least 2.200 people have been arrested and 24 reported dead.

Rodney Guerrero, 27, who helped organize Saturday’s rally at the Capitol, said he was threatened, persecuted and imprisoned in Venezuela because of his political activism. Three months ago, he came to the United States and was granted humanitarian parole.

“It is extremely important to highlight what is happening in Venezuela,” said Guerrero. “Not only the theft of the election, that is notorious, but also the violation of human rights.”

Guerrero said the government began a repressive operation called “knock knock” almost immediately after the election.

“They go to the houses of people who have been photographed or recorded at the marches, they knock at their door and they detain them without any due process, without any arrest warrant.”

Sabrina Contreras, 30, who co-organized the Capitol rally, adds that social media also has been monitored as part of the government's crackdown on protesters. From Minnesota, she coordinates with protesters in Venezuela: they send her content and members of the diaspora publish it on social media to ensure the protestors’ safety.

Contreras was part of the party Primero Justicia, or Justice First, in Venezuela. She has been living in Minnesota for seven years now, but her parents and her brother have not left the country. And they do not plan to any time soon. “Everybody is just fighting for the truth, for freedom, in the streets,” she said. “We are just waiting for a peaceful transition.”

Joeliz Rodriguez, 29, attended Saturday’s rally to use the freedom she has in the U.S. to speak out for those in Venezuela who have been silenced. She arrived in Minnesota a year ago after living in Ecuador for five years. Her husband crossed Panama’s Darien jungle to reach the U.S., and she joined him with their toddler afterwards. Her cousins have left the country as well. Only her parents and grandparents still live in Venezuela.

“The state where I am from, Zulia, Venezuela’s oil state, is where there are the most calamities,” she said. “The lights go off a lot, there is no good hospital infrastructure, there are no medications, there are few job opportunities.”

Waving a large Venezuelan flag above the crowd, Alessandra Bajetti, 21, came with her family to the rally. She was born in the U.S., but her family is scattered around the globe. Bajetti’s grandma had not left Venezuela. But now, she is planning to move to Mexico, to join some of her relatives and be in a safer place.

For Bajetti, who’s studying politics, it is the first time an opposition party is strong enough to take down the government.

“These elections were huge because we haven't felt this much hope since Chavez was brought into power in 1998,” she said. “If there is something Venezuelans carry, it is hope.”

Who is Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan? A ‘hard-nosed’ negotiator fighting for Minnesota kids,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/peggy-flanagan-minnesota-lieutenant-governor-tim-walz/,2024-08-06,"Becky Z. Dernbach, More Becky Z.

She served on the Minneapolis school board, worked as executive director of the Children’s Defense Fund Minnesota, and advocated for kids as a state legislator and lieutenant governor.

Now, she may bring that passion to the governor’s mansion. On Tuesday, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris named Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. If Walz becomes vice president, Flanagan will step in as governor. She would be Minnesota’s first female governor and first Native American governor — and the first female Native American governor in the country.

The governor’s communications office did not respond to Sahan Journal requests to interview Flanagan this week. As second-in-command, she has sometimes been less visible than Walz. But her friends and political allies say she has consistently played a pivotal role in negotiating policies that benefit children and families, while bringing community groups to the table. They expect she would bring that approach to the governor’s office.

“Peggy’s hallmark is always policy that will directly impact Minnesota families,” said Carin Mrotz, a close friend of Flanagan’s and senior adviser in the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office.

“No one fights harder than Peggy for kids,” said Representative Jamie Becker-Finn, DFL-Roseville.

Mrotz described Flanagan as an “extremely hard-nosed policy negotiator” and said she had worked closely with Walz on many key initiatives.

“Free school lunches was very much a team effort, and I see Peggy Flanagan’s hands all over that,” Mrotz said.

She also pointed to Minnesota’s work in recent years to develop a first-in-the-nation state office for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives.

“That’s them as a team, but I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the governor has prioritized those things,” Mrotz said.

She also recounted how when Flanagan was first elected as lieutenant governor, she spearheaded efforts to raise cash payments for the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP). In 2019, when Flanagan took office, the payments had remained stagnant since 1986 — when Flanagan was in first grade. Flanagan led the effort to negotiate a $100 monthly increase to the program.

“Hardworking families who are still living in poverty are experiencing more money in their pockets, and that’s because of Peggy Flanagan,” Mrotz said.

A ‘young whippersnapper’

Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, grew up in St. Louis Park, where she still lives with her family. Her father, Marvin Manypenny, was a longtime activist who spoke out against the loss of White Earth land. When she was a child, her family relied on public assistance; she’s spoken frequently about coming to school with a different-colored lunch ticket. She previously told Sahan Journal that she felt “invisible in my own classroom” because of the limited representation of Indigenous people in St. Louis Park Schools at the time.

In 2004, Flanagan, then 25, was elected to the Minneapolis school board. Javier Morillo, the former president of Service Employees International Union Local 26, remembers being impressed with the polish of the “young whippersnapper” when screening candidates for endorsements. Morillo now considers Flanagan his best friend, and is godfather to her daughter.

They worked closely together during a 2014 campaign to raise the Minnesota minimum wage. At that time, Minnesota Democrats held a trifecta of the House, Senate, and governor’s office. The state minimum wage was $6.15 for large employers, below the federal minimum wage of $7.25.

Flanagan, then the executive director of Children’s Defense Fund Minnesota, co-chaired the Raise the Wage Coalition. The coalition aimed to raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour by 2016. Morillo recalled that Flanagan led a subgroup to make sure that the new minimum wage would be indexed to inflation. Though Democrats held a trifecta, this point was controversial among some Senate Democrats, Morillo recalled.

At one point, Morillo said, the coalition reached a compromise on minimum wage that would have left out the inflationary indexes. But Flanagan refused to accept that concession, Morillo said, at one point physically blocking a chalkboard that laid out the compromise during a coalition meeting. She helped lead a subgroup to make sure indexing was part of the final law.

In the end, the final bill included inflationary increases. Because of those yearly raises, Minnesota’s minimum wage for large employers is now $10.85.

Flanagan is “accomplished, ready and history-making,” Morillo said.

Keeping incarcerated moms with babies

Flanagan was elected to the Legislature in 2015 during a special election. The incumbent legislator, Rep. Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, resigned to follow his family when his wife took a job in Belgium.

The year after Flanagan was seated in the Legislature, Becker-Finn, a Leech Lake Ojibwe descendant, joined her. The two bonded right away as the only Ojibwe women in the Legislature, Becker-Finn recalled.

“We were immediately really good friends going through that together,” Becker-Finn said.

During the 2017-2018 legislative session, Republicans held the majority in the Minnesota House. Becker-Finn said she and Flanagan, who had different areas of expertise, often found themselves combing through newly introduced bills to identify negative impacts for tribal communities and trying to explain them to bill authors.

In October 2017, Walz, then a member of Congress running for governor, announced that Flanagan would be his running mate. The gubernatorial election was still more than a year away. Walz announced Flanagan as his running mate at an unusually early moment, in an effort to show that together they would represent all of Minnesota — rural white voters like Walz, and voters of color from urban and suburban areas like Flanagan.

Becker-Finn introduced Flanagan at her first event as a candidate for lieutenant governor, at the American Indian Center in Minneapolis. After Walz and Flanagan won the election, Becker-Finn saw how Flanagan used her influence to shape policy.

In 2019, Flanagan and Becker-Finn visited the Minnesota Correctional Facility in Shakopee, the state’s only women’s prison. While there, they met with incarcerated women, guards, social workers and doulas. Becker-Finn said they learned from those women “that we were still as a state doing the practice of taking newborn babies away from their moms.”

For Flanagan and Becker-Finn, both mothers, the insight hit hard: “Putting yourself in the shoes of those women and imagining what that would have been like to have your baby taken out of your arms at 36 hours old,” Becker-Finn said.

Flanagan directed staff at the Department of Corrections to author a bill to change this practice, while Becker-Finn led the effort at the Legislature. At that time, Minnesota had a politically divided Legislature; the push attracted bipartisan support.

In 2021, Walz signed the Healthy Start Act, which allows women who are pregnant or recently postpartum at the time of their sentencing to serve their time in a halfway house or community alternative for up to a year. Minnesota was believed to be the first state to implement such a program.

“If I tried to do that on my own without Peggy and without her leveraging the resources that she had as lieutenant governor, I don’t think that would have been a thing we were able to get done as quickly as we did,” Becker-Finn said.

She also pointed to Flanagan’s work in pushing the state to codify Minnesota’s relationship with tribal governments into statute.

“Things like that are trickier than they might seem to get across the finish line,” she said. “Both the governor and Peggy have visited tribal nations. They’ve actually put in the work.”

Indigenous education

Another focus for Flanagan has been making sure all Minnesota kids have access to education about Indigenous history and contemporary knowledge. In 2021, she spoke with Sahan Journal about the state’s efforts to provide better curricular resources to teachers. Since that time, Minnesota has adopted new social studies standards that also require more education about Indigenous communities.

Flanagan told Sahan Journal that this initiative came directly from tribal leaders, who made it a top priority. She said that when she was growing up attending St. Louis Park Schools, the curriculum did not reflect her lived experience.

“When you don’t see yourself reflected in your teachers or curriculum, there is an impact,” she said. “To be really candid, it made me feel like I was invisible in my own classroom.”

For Indigenous people in particular, many of whom are just a generation or two away from family members being forcibly removed to boarding schools, this erasure can fuel distrust in the education system, she said.

But she noted that for her daughter, in the same school system, representation was starting to improve.

“I think making sure that our Black, Indigenous, and students of color see themselves reflected in their curriculum, and that it is taught in a way that also makes them feel valued, is a game changer,” she said.

Governor Flanagan?

So what would a Flanagan governorship look like?

It’s early to say. But her friends and political allies look forward to seeing how her approach to leadership could change state government.

Mrotz said that she expected Flanagan to find more ways to bring more voices to the table in decisionmaking.

“She is somebody who is like, ‘Well, then let’s build a bigger table, and then we can have more people sitting here,’” Mrotz said.

Becker-Finn reflected on the contradictions of being a Native American elected official in a system that was “designed to destroy your people.” She said Flanagan might question processes and structures that weren’t designed to include everyone.

“I think Peggy won’t be afraid to be open to doing things in better ways that are more reflective of our values and of the reality of what a Minnesotan looks like,” she said. “I just think she’s going to be really intentional about that.”"
"VP nominee Tim Walz praised for advancing policies for communities of color, immigrants",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/kamala-harris-minnesota-governor-tim-walz-vice-president-pick/,2024-08-06,"Joey Peters, Becky Z.

Community leaders also touted his advocacy for Minnesota’s communities of color, including the signing of several laws that extended benefits to undocumented immigrants.

“I am thrilled,” said Sara Lopez, policy director for Unidos Minnesota, an immigrant advocacy group. “He knows how to work with women of color and share power with women of color.”

Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, shared a similar thought in a prepared statement.

“The last two years are a shining example that Tim Walz is good at working with strong women in full collaboration to get things done,” Hortman said. “I am thrilled by Kamala Harris’s candidacy and believe Governor Walz is a strong addition to the ticket.”

The announcement Tuesday that Walz is joining Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, could set in motion a historic makeover of Minnesota state government. Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, would become Minnesota’s first female — and Native American — governor. Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, stands to become lieutenant governor, and would be the first Black person in that role.

Over the 2023-2024 legislative session, Walz worked closely with Hortman as well as Senate Majority Leaders Kari Dziedzic, DFL-Minneapolis, and Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, to pass a raft of progressive legislation: free breakfast and lunch for all Minnesota school children, codifying abortion rights into law, driver’s licenses and health insurance for undocumented immigrants, legal recreational marijuana, free college for low-income students and paid sick time and family leave for workers.

Walz and Flanagan first ran for governor and lieutenant governor in 2018 under the moniker, “One Minnesota.” Together, they promised to represent both white Minnesotans from rural areas, like Walz, and Minnesotans of color from urban areas, like Flanagan. Walz is expected to play a similar balancing role for Harris, the first Black and South Asian woman to head a major party ticket.

Emilia Gonazález Avalos, Unidos’ executive director, characterized Walz as Minnesota’s “most pro-immigrant governor” ever. That includes the period before Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers dominated the state Senate and House during the 2023-2024 legislative session, Gonazález Avalos said.

Before then, Walz issued used his discretion to extend coverage from emergency Medical Assistance — the state’s name for Medicaid — for COVID-19 related injuries. This was important, Gonazález Avalos said, because undocumented immigrants are eligible to use emergency Medical Assistance. This impacted Gonazález Avalos’s own dad, who is undocumented and suffered the effects in 2020 of a severe case of COVID-19.

“For people like my dad, that meant a whole lot,” Gonazález Avalos said.

Gonazález Avalos also pointed to how Walz used his discretion to fund the Minnesota Dream Act, which gives scholarships to undocumented immigrants.

Rosa Tock, the executive director of the Minnesota Council on Latino Affairs, said immigrants and people of color gained greater visibility under Walz’s administration. She praised many bills Walz signed into law, including one that makes it easier for educators to earn a license to teach heritage languages, and another that requires all Minnesota schools to offer an ethnic studies course.

The DFL won control of the Legislature in 2022, paving the way for Walz to sign the Drivers License for All bill into law last year, allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for a driver’s license. Similar bills had unsuccessfully been introduced in the Legislature for more than a decade. The free breakfast and lunch bill he signed the same year also applied to undocumented schoolchildren.

“He has been very supportive of issues that many communities of color have been advocating for,” said Tock, who noted that she was speaking on behalf of herself and not the Minnesota Council on Latino Affairs.

She added that it’s “in Minnesota’s DNA” to put a local politician in the vice president’s office, citing Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale.

Strengths and liabilities

David Schultz, a political science professor with Hamline University, said that by picking Walz, Harris “is making it clear that she is running as a progressive candidate.”

Walz, whose political career extends nearly 20 years, started out as a moderate Democratic member of Congress representing southern Minnesota’s conservative, rural First District. Walz grew up in Butte, Nebraska, a town of about 400 people, and enrolled in the National Guard upon graduating high school. He began a teaching career in his home state and then moved to Mankato in the mid-1990s, where he taught high school geography and coached football. He was first elected to Congress in 2006.

Since being elected governor in 2018, Walz has clearly moved to the left, Schultz said.

“When Democrats got the trifecta two years ago, that pushed Minnesota politics to the left, and Walz went with it,” Schultz said.

Walz grabbed a national spotlight last month by appearing in television interviews where he criticized Trump and MAGA politics, coining that brand of politics as “weird.” In doing so, Schultz said, Walz emerged as “a very forceful and articulate critic of both Trump and the Republicans, but also in defending core Democratic Party values.”

That’s very attractive for the Democratic Party’s base, Schultz said, but a potential risk in key swing states like Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania.

“Those states are certainly more conservative than Minnesota,” Schultz said. “The center of their politics is clearly to the right of Minnesota.”

Walz’s potential liabilities include criticism about his handling of the riots that broke out in 2020 following George Floyd’s murder by former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. Republicans have criticized Walz for not acting quickly enough to stop the unrest, which occurred over multiple nights and caused millions of dollars in damage. Walz eventually called the Minnesota National Guard to quell the unrest, but not until after protesters had forced police to flee Minneapolis Police’s Third Precinct office, which was then set ablaze.

Walz could also face scrutiny for the Feeding Our Future fraud case, which involved the alleged theft of $250 million in federal food-aid money that was earmarked to feed underserved children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prosecutors have said the case, which is centered in Minnesota, is the biggest pandemic-related fraud in the nation.

Walz’s Department of Education oversaw how the federal dollars were distributed to local nonprofits and businesses, which were supposed to feed children but instead, used the money to buy real estate and luxury goods. A state audit issued in June criticized the department for its handling of the money, and some state Republicans accused Walz’s administration in 2022 of failing to stop the fraud.

While those issues did not move Minnesota voters to reject Walz’s run for a second term as governor, Schultz said he thinks they will be more effective in attack ads in a national election cycle.

Salman Fiqy, a medical consultant in Burnsville and former Republican candidate for state House, said that some voters may see Walz as appealing in an everyman way. But he said Walz’s tenure as governor included positions on public safety and education that are turning Somali voters away from the Democratic Party.

Fiqy in particular takes issue with the Feeding Our Future case, saying that Walz shares the blame for allowing the fraud to occur. Several defendants have pleaded guilty in the case or were convicted of fraud at trial.

“He made it easy for people to take advantage of that weak system,” Fiqy said.

The case has negatively impacted Minnesota’s Somali community as a whole, Fiqy argued. Most of the 70 defendants charged in the case are East African. Fiqy said one of his friends bears the same name as Abdiaziz Farah, a defendant who was found guilty in June of fraud and money laundering. Wherever his friend goes, Fiqy said, people see his name and mistake him for the defendant.

The defendants in the case “did the crime no doubt,” Fiqy said, “but a part of the issue was the weak system that was implemented by the administration headed by Tim Walz.”"

On Tuesday, August 13, Minnesota voters will choose major party candidates for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House and state legislative races, and winnow the field in some nonpartisan local races.

Among the most closely watched contests are the DFL rematch between Representative Ilhan Omar and former Minneapolis Council Member Don Samuels. Two years ago, Omar narrowly defeated Samuels in the primary to represent the reliably blue Fifth Congressional District.

Republicans, meanwhile, are choosing their candidate to challenge third-term DFL U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, with former NBA player Royce White facing businessman Joe Fraser.

In addition to the federal races, all 134 Minnesota House seats will be on the ballot in November. The DFL currently holds a narrow majority in the House, while the Senate is evenly split pending a special election in November.

Here’s a guide to everything you need to know before the election next Tuesday.

How do I register to vote in the primary?

It should be straightforward: If you’re not already registered to vote, you can register at your polling place on Election Day. All you need to bring is a government-issued photo ID like a driver’s license, or a lease or utility bill with your name and current address.

All U.S. citizens 18 and older who have been Minnesota residents for at least 20 days are eligible to vote, unless incarcerated for a felony or under a court order revoking their right to vote.

This year, for the first time, felons who have completed their terms of incarceration are also eligible to vote while on parole, probation, or work release.

How do I find my polling place?

Your polling place is determined by the address from which you registered to vote and should be located relatively close to your residence.

You can find your polling location here and also see a list of candidates and questions that will be on your ballot.

How can I vote early in person or by mail?

Early voting for this primary election began on June 28 and will run through August 12. A handful of polling locations are open.

If you’re going to be out of town on Election Day, need assistance, or simply prefer to vote at home, you can request that your county elections office send an absentee ballot to your address. After you receive your ballot, you can then fill it out, get a witness or notary to sign it, and then mail it back or drop it off at a ballot drop site.

All ballots, including absentee ballots, must be received by 8 p.m. on August 13 when the polls close. Even if your ballot is postmarked before the polls close on Election Day, if it is not received by 8 p.m., it will not be counted.

You can keep track of the status of your ballot and see when it has been received here.

What’s on the ballot this year?

All kinds of things. The primaries for Congress, including the U.S. Senate race involving Klobuchar, primaries for seats in the state legislature, and a range of nonpartisan races for positions in city and county governments, on school boards, and more.

You can only vote for candidates in one party, though you can choose the party whose primary elections you want to participate in regardless of your party registration.

The winners of these races will advance to the general election, which will be held on November 5 alongside the presidential election.

What are my rights while voting?

You are allowed to take time off to work to vote without losing any pay, including paid time off. You can learn more about that right here.

You are also allowed to bring children into your polling place, get a replacement ballot if you make a mistake while filling out your ballot, and vote without anyone in the polling place attempting to in any way influence your decisions. The Minnesota Secretary of State’s office has put together a voting rights fact sheet, which you can view and download here.

The polls are open until 8 p.m. on Election Day; if you are in line by 8 p.m., you will be allowed to vote.

How can I request an interpreter?

If you prefer to navigate the voting process in a language other than English, you have the right to request an interpreter. If there is no interpreter at your polling location for your preferred language, the on-site election judge will call an interpreter to provide assistance over the phone.

You can also bring a friend or family member with you to help you vote. The only people you can’t receive assistance voting from are an employer or fellow union member. Voting instructions will be available at polling places in Spanish, Hmong, and Somali.

Where can I find more information?

You can find an explanation of the primary election and other helpful links on the Secretary of State’s website here. You can also view complete election results after the polls close on August 13 here."
Kamala Harris campaign stumps at Minnesota’s Hmong Village,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/kamala-harris-campaign-wastes-no-time-stumping-in-minnesotas-hmong-community-with-stop-at-hmong-village/,2024-07-23,"Joey Peters, Becky Z.

Campaign staffers and surrogates in Minnesota characterized Tuesday’s efforts as the start of shoring up a key constituency for success in November. Shivanthi Sathanandan, vice chair of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, is focused on Asian voters as the campaign’s battleground states director for South Asians for Harris.

Sathanandan said Harris’s own South Asian heritage — Harris is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father — is motivating Asian voters.

“Representation matters,” said Sathanandan, who campaigned at Tuesday’s events. “The energy that comes from seeing someone from a shared culture, whether they’re Black or Asian American or South Asian or just a woman, that energy is contagious, and it’s exciting.”

Sathanandan said the campaign is preparing to do hefty outreach to Asian communities between now and election day, November 5. President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he was no longer seeking reelection, and threw his support behind Harris, his vice president.

“The campaign will be doing extensive outreach, door knocking, community events,” said St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, a Harris supporter who is also a delegate for next month’s Democratic National Convention. “In Minnesota, we have a significant number of elected officials from our Asian American community who will be leading the way. I’ll be following them to see how we can engage in all the different ways.”

Carter was one of several Harris surrogates participating in the campaign events in St. Paul. The campaign listened to voters rather than espousing talking points.

Asian voters at the campaign stops offered nuanced perspectives on Harris’ candidacy.

Mai Xiong, who runs M Produce at Hmong Village, plans to vote for Harris this fall, and said a lot of people she knows support Harris because of her experience more than her gender or ethnicity. Harris previously served as California’s attorney general and as a U.S. senator for the state. She ran for the 2020 presidency before dropping out and joining Biden as his running mate.

“She will get a lot of Asian votes,” Xiong said. “I can feel it.”

Ying Sa, CEO and Principal Certified Public Accountant at Minneapolis-based Community CPA, said Harris’s ethnicity alone will not win over Asian voters. Sa, who immigrated from China to Canada and, eventually, the United States, said Republican candidate Donald Trump is also finding ways to motivate some Asian voters.

“For a lot of Chinese people, when Donald Trump praises [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping], that makes them feel good,” she said.

No previous U.S. president has praised dictators the way Trump has, said Sa, adding that she knows many Chinese Americans who support him because of his praise. Sa said she believes that U.S. politics is more about culture than policy for many voters, and that many Chinese immigrants have forgotten what it’s like to live under a dictatorship.

Sa herself said she plans to vote for Harris, not because she likes Harris, but because she despises Trump, who called COVID-19 the “China virus” during his July 18 speech at the Republican National Convention.

However, during a business roundtable with Hmong and Asian business owners at St. Paul-based development company JB Vang, Sa said that in her experience, small businesses do worse when a Democrat is in the White House.

“Democrats tend to regulate businesses, which is a good thing,” Sa said during the roundtable. “But the IRS only knows how to drill small businesses, because they’re easy to audit.”

Kou Vang, president and CEO of JB Vang, also participated in the roundtable. He said that he’s undecided on who to vote for in the coming election, and that he’s previously voted for candidates from different political parties. He also doesn’t think Harris’ ethnicity alone will motivate many Asian voters.

“I think Asian folks are pretty practical people,” Vang said, referring to East Asian and Southeast Asian voters in particular. “I don’t think we let emotions play that much into how we vote. I think we vote based on what we think is best for us.”

Vang said he believes many Asians lean philosophically Republican by nature, in that they’re pro-business and pro-entrepreneur. Socioeconomically, however, Vang said, many Asians are Democrats, in that they’re recent immigrants and “need the policies that help us get out from under our feet.”

He said it’s “a big miss” that Republicans don’t appear to be targeting the Asian vote.

Carter maintained that the general excitement around Harris’ campaign is already equivalent to Barack Obama’s first campaign for president in 2008. In the three days since Biden dropped out, the Minnesota chapter of Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign received 200 calls from people who wanted to volunteer, Carter said.

“Some of the conversations in which I thought I was calling to convince somebody, I found out really quickly they were already convinced, already ready to go, and had already donated online,” he said. “So just that, that level of palpable energy is exciting.”

St. Paul City Council Member Hwa Jeong Kim, a DFLer, had a more nuanced take on the matter.

Kim, a progressive, also helped the Harris campaign with its events Tuesday, and plans to continue volunteering. She believes Harris’ ethnicity will help motivate voters of color in general.

“Identity is a really important piece of representation in politics and representation in power,” Kim said. “I think really what people of color are after are shared liberation, radical policies that lift all of us up together and really addressing root causes to some of the things that we see happening in our own neighborhoods.”

But Kim voted uncommitted in the Democratic presidential primary in March because of Biden’s handling of Israel’s war against Hamas, and said that in many cases, she’s still waiting to see Harris’ policies. She noted that some other uncommitted voters she’s heard from are reassured by Harris replacing Biden, while others are going to need more convincing.

“Is Kamala going to be very open again about a ceasefire? The issues still remain,” Kim said of the Israel-Hamas war. “I’d really love to see how Kamala is going to step out of the past administration and come forward and be really progressive on issues that matter.”

Kim’s plan for winning over progressive voters who are still reluctant to support Harris is to outline the consequences should Trump win.

“Our democracy is on the ballot,” she said. “There’s no candidate that is going to be perfect. Progress is a faith based practice.”

‘Elect the first auntie’

The Harris campaign’s stump concluded with a rally of about 35 people in an office building in the Midway neighborhood of St. Paul, where Carter and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey both expressed enthusiasm for Harris before introducing the mayor of Cincinnati, Aftab Pureval.

“You might be wondering, why is the mayor of Cincinnati here in the Twin Cities?” Pureval asked. “It’s because we have an opportunity to elect the first auntie, the first Asian American president in our country’s history.”

Pureval’s mother was born in Tibet and grew up as a refugee in India, where she met Pureval’s father. The couple immigrated to the United States and raised Pureval in southern Ohio.

He recounted the effects of the Trump administration, including an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The crowd went still when he described one impact of Trump’s Supreme Court appointments on his home state. In 2022, a 9-year-old Ohio girl was raped and became pregnant. But because the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade, and a recent law in Ohio banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, she had to travel to Indiana for an abortion.

Pureval described Ohio’s Republican leaders’ reaction to this child’s story. “When they found out about it, not only were they not shocked, not only were they not aghast, they denied that she existed,” he said. “This is a time for everyday citizens to take a look at the choice in November, and to choose the side of equity and justice and hope and community.”

Pureval explained that he was in St. Paul because Democrats could not likely win Ohio in the presidential race. In Minnesota, he said, organizing and activism matter greatly.

“Vice President Harris cannot win without coming through and winning Minnesota,” he said. “You have to have our auntie’s back.”

“We do,” said someone in the crowd.

After the rally, Leah Midgarden, a Korean adoptee and DFL activist, said that while she was sad to see Biden step down, she was “thrilled that we get a second swing of the bat to elect the first woman president.”

She said she felt the weight of history at having the opportunity to help elect two transformational presidents in her lifetime: Obama and now, Harris.

Growing up in rural North Dakota, Midgarden was the only Asian girl in her small school. She recalled wishing she could grow up to be tall, blond, and blue-eyed like her cousins.

“To know that there are young girls today who are going to have the opportunity to grow up and see that you can be smart, powerful, hardworking and Asian, and rise to the most important position in the world, and do it without having to pass as white — that just makes me so proud,” she said."

But they also say they want more details about her policies.

When President Joe Biden abruptly ended his campaign Sunday afternoon, he endorsed Harris as the next Democratic nominee. Harris, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from India and Jamaica, quickly emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president. She stands to make history as the first female president, the first Asian American president, and the second Black president. And she has just 107 days to run her campaign.

While the nomination won’t be official until August, no other Democrat has emerged to challenge Harris, who raised a record $81 million in the first day of her campaign. She’s since received endorsements from high-ranking Democrats such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Ilhan Omar.

Replacing Biden with Harris so close to the election is a move that some strategists hope will energize and mobilize voters of color. Will it work? Sahan Journal checked in with voters from communities of color in the Twin Cities, including Indian Americans in Eden Prairie and Black voters in the Rondo neighborhood of St. Paul, to learn more about how they are feeling about Biden’s exit and Harris stepping in to run for president.

Indian American voters hold mixed feelings

Srinivas Vuppula, the head chef at India Spice House in Eden Prairie, said he “100%” plans to vote for Kamala Harris. He supports her policies and alignment with Biden, but said that it doesn’t matter to him that she is part of the Indian American community.

“I like Kamala Harris and how she’s cooperated with Biden,” Vuppula said.

Sohil Goorha, a restaurant owner who lives in Eden Prairie, isn’t as sure. He said he’s currently an undecided voter.

“In the end what matters is what policies are important, what affects common people. I vote on policies that support the small business community,” Goorha said. “Ask the small business owners, ask the small guys. They don’t care about ethnicity and race. They care about taxes, they care about being able to stay alive.”

Amongst his friends and family, Goorha said many people in his community agree that Biden stepping down was a step in the right direction. But said he is still skeptical as to whether Harris will champion economic issues.

“They definitely feel that Biden retiring is a great thing,” Goorha said of his community. “Now you took the only factor that the Republicans were attacking the Democrats on — his age — out of the equation. So it does definitely open the game.”

Sayali Bongale, an Eden Prairie resident who moved to the U.S. in 2016, first noticed Harris during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in 2018. She turned the TV on for just background noise, but was impressed by then-Senator Harris’ questions regarding abortion and women’s health.



“‘Do you know about any government rule about men’s bodies?’” Bongale remembered Harris asking. “He was not able to answer. I was really impressed.”

Bongale moved to the U.S. in 2016, three months before Donald Trump was elected president. She said she felt scared because, at the time, she was waiting to receive work authorization and thought Trump’s crackdown on immigration might pose a barrier.

Bongale said she hopes to see Harris address the strains on the immigration system, particularly the backlog in green card approvals and work visas.

“You rarely see someone of your skin color or Indian origin be on stage and come to that level, so I am [excited],” Bongale said. Despite her excitement, she added she has mixed feelings. “Because she comes from an immigrant background, it will be interesting. Because even though they are from those backgrounds, when they get that power they don’t make any changes.”

Uncommitted campaign calls Biden’s exit ‘good news’

Asma Mohammed, the lead organizer of Uncommitted Minnesota, which mobilized 19% of Minnesota’s Democratic primary voters to cast a protest vote against Biden’s approach to the war in Gaza, said she had not seen a particular affinity for Harris from Indian Muslims.

“I don’t think they recognize her as one of our own at all,” she said.

Mohammed described Biden’s exit and endorsement of Harris as “good news.” She pointed to distinctions between Harris’ and Biden’s positions on Israel.

“Joe Biden was not going to engage with the anti-genocide crowd at all,” Mohammed said. “The difference now is that the vice president was at times making concessions to people who are supportive of Palestine and the Palestinian people. So I think that we have an opportunity here, and so does the vice president. It’s possible that we could win in November, if the vice president engages with our coalition of nearly a million voters who have said that they won’t stand for genocide.”

As an uncommitted delegate to the Democratic National Convention, Mohammed said she hoped for an open convention so that delegates could press the potential nominee on a permanent ceasefire and arms embargo against Israel.

“I think because Vice President Harris wants to win, is newly thrusted into the limelight, and also because she has clearly been a little bit better on Palestine, I think that she might be more open to accepting that Palestinians deserve to live,” Mohammed said.

‘A new level of hope’

Brittany Wright met Harris during a March visit to St. Paul focused on reproductive rights. Wright, a family wellness advocate, podcast host, and DJ and state employee, spoke to Sahan Journal in her personal capacity.

The 33-year-old mom almost died when giving birth to her 5-year-old daughter. Through her work at the Minnesota Children’s Cabinet, she helped advise the Biden/Harris administration on infant and maternal health. She had previously observed Harris as a background figure in the news, poised and diplomatic, she said. But in person, Wright saw a different side of her.

“It was kindness, it was warmth, and there was a level of depth in humanity that I just don’t feel like the media has done a great job of showcasing,” Wright said.

Wright and Harris both belong to historically Black sororities, which became an immediate point of connection, Wright said.

“She spoke to me like a sister or a family member,” she said. “She was so personable, and that was just really affirming to see: that you can make it to that level of government and still keep your humanity intact.”

Wright said she was shocked when she heard the news, and praised Biden as “selfless.”

“From a political standpoint, I felt an extreme sense of gratitude,” she said. “From a personal standpoint as a Black woman, as a woman of color, I felt incredibly proud and thankful that people are able to see just what we’re capable of in this moment.”

Wright had planned to vote for Biden. But now that Harris is the likely nominee, she plans to be more engaged in the election, she said. Because of racism and sexism, the election might be more of an “uphill battle” for Harris, she said, so she felt a sense of responsibility to get more involved: organizing within her sorority, having conversations at the dinner table, or giving rides to the polls.

Wright said she hoped Harris would focus on the issues that voters care about, like the war in Gaza, criminal justice reform, health equity, student loans, and the economy.

“I think that there’s been a new level of hope and energy and optimism,” she said.

Rondo voters: ‘Anybody but Trump’

In the Rondo neighborhood in St. Paul, voters expressed a mix of caution and confidence in Harris — but many said they would vote for anyone over Trump.

“I wish her the best of luck,” said Ilka Bird, owner of Get Gorgeous Salon and Spa. “Too bad for Biden that he wasn’t going to be able to complete another term. Lucky Kamala, right place at the right time.”

Bird, though, said she needed more information about Harris. “As far as her views, I’m going to wait and see,” she said.

Around the corner at Hamburguesas El Gordo, Marta Mendez, the manager, said she thought Harris would be better than Trump.

“He don’t like the Latin people,” she said. “Any person is better than Trump.”

In front of Golden Thyme Presents, a business accelerator, a group of four friends sat on a stoop.

“She’ll be good,” said Bear Carter. “She was already smart, and she learned a lot from him,” he said, referring to Biden.

Carter was impressed that Harris raised so much money so quickly, though he said he’d heard from a lot of people upset that Biden dropped out. He said he worried that if Trump got into office, the country would fall into a depression.

His friend Dave Wiley derided Trump’s recent remarks about “Black jobs” and a “bloodbath” if he loses. Wiley said the “bloodbath” remark was a threat of a race war.

Harris had learned a lot in four years, he said, while Trump had not. He worried that Trump’s agenda for a second term, Project 2025, would “divide America.”

“I’d rather have anybody but Trump,” he said."
Activists call on Don Samuels to take down ‘anti-woman’ ad featuring Ilhan Omar,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/don-samuels-ilhan-omar-minneapolis-fifth-district-race-controversial-ad/,2024-07-19,"Hibah Ansari, More Hibah Ansari, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SamuelsAdBacklash-3722.jpg,"Activists are calling on former Minneapolis City Council Member Don Samuels to take down a new ad targeting Congresswoman Ilhan Omar that they say is insensitive, racist and “anti-woman.”

Samuels and Omar are facing off for the second time in two years in a DFL primary for the Fifth Congressional District seat. Samuels posted his campaign’s first ad Wednesday.

The ad begins with images of downtown Minneapolis and zeroes in on a “Missing” poster with Omar’s face. “Ilhan Omar has gone missing on the issues that matter most for us,” a narrator says. The ad then criticizes Omar’s stance on police reform and infrastructure bills as repeated images of the Missing poster with Omar’s face appear.

At a news conference Friday, advocates said the images in the ad were insensitive and ignored the disproportionately high rates of missing and murdered women in the Indigenous and Black communities.

“Our children, our sisters, our moms, they’re missing,” said Lakeisha Lee, who helped establish the nation’s first Murdered and Missing Black Women and Girls Office in Minnesota this year. “A political ad putting anyone’s face on a missing poster in 2024 is uncalled for.”

In Minnesota, Indigenous women and girls make up just 1% of the population, but account for 8% of the state’s female homicides. And Black women are nearly three times more likely to be killed than their white peers.

Last year, Omar introduced the Brittany Clardy Missing and Murdered Black Women and Girls Act, named after Lee’s sister, to create a federal office modeled after the Minnesota one. The Missing and Murdered African American Women Task Force, which Lee co-chaired, reported that over 60,000 Black women and girls were missing in the U.S. in 2022.

Lee’s 18-year-old sister, Brittany Clardy, went missing in 2013. Her beaten body was found 10 days later in an impounded car. The incident sparked a decade of Lee’s advocacy for missing and murdered Black women and girls.

Friday morning’s news conference was held at the Memorial to Survivors of Sexual Assault at Boom Island Park in Minneapolis. Asma Mohammed, advocacy director for Reviving the Islamic Sisterhood for Empowerment, helped establish the memorial in 2020.

“I remind you that there are survivors watching, Don,” Mohammed said. “Don, if you cared at all about the women in this district you would have known better. We call on you now to take down your insensitive, racist, anti-women ad now.”

Sue Goodstar of Camp Nenookaasi also spoke at the news conference and said the ad “enraged” her.

“This is what a missing persons poster looks like,” Goodstar said as she held up a missing poster for Kateri Mishow, an Indigenous woman who was 22 at the time she went missing in Minneapolis. “Kateri is a friend of mine, and she’s been missing for 17 years. Ilhan is not missing. Ilhan’s in office.”

Jackie Rogers, a spokeswoman for Omar’s campaign, said the campaign hopes Samuels listens to community leaders and takes the ad down.

“It is shameful, yet unsurprising the Don Samuels campaign would weaponize the plight of missing Black and Indigenous women for his political gain,” Rogers said in a statement on behalf of Omar’s campaign. “His latest ad ignores the disproportionate rate of violence Black and Indigenous women experience.”

Toshira Garraway Allen, founder of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence, spoke about the father of her son who was found dead in a dumpster after being pulled over by St. Paul police in 2009.

“This is mocking to the families who have actually endured this. This is painful, this is hurtful, this is disrespectful to the families that have actually experienced their loved ones being missing,” Garraway Allen said. “You don’t have to take it this far to advertise yourself.”

Following the news conference Friday, Don Samuels’ campaign said he did not plan to take down the ad. In an emailed statement, the campaign doubled down on criticism of Omar’s record.

“Don Samuels has spent a lifetime working with his neighbors to make neighborhoods like his in north Minneapolis safer for everyone — including and especially Black women and children,” the statement said. “Rep. Ilhan Omar has been missing, at best, when it comes to making her constituents safer and, at worst, actively undermining efforts to improve safety.”

The advocates said they are in touch with Omar but did not comment further. While they have not personally communicated with Samuels’ campaign, some of the advocates said they may consider having a conversation with him if the ad is taken down.

“It’s really hard for myself, a Black woman, to reach out to this man knowing this,” Garraway Allen said. “Once he takes the ad down, then we can maybe have a conversation and truly let him know how we feel.”

It’s not the first time Samuels has made controversial remarks about Omar in the 2024 race. Samuels called Omar a “pawn for Hamas” in a WCCO interview in June, referring to her support for Palestinians and calls for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

Votes will pick the top DFL and GOP candidates in Minnesota’s August 13 primary. In 2022, Omar narrowly defeated Samuels in the DFL primary with 51% of the vote."
"Some Somali voters say economy, social issues are driving them to vote for Trump",https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/somali-voters-republican-party-trump-biden-election/,2024-07-15,"Joey Peters, More Joey Peters, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SJ108376.jpg,"Salman Fiqy arrived in Minnesota on a historic day — January 20, 2009, when Barack Obama took office as president for the first time.

Salman, who was 19 at the time, was excited.

“I wasn’t a conservative then — I was a Democrat,” he said.

That changed throughout the years, as Salman obtained a biology degree from Minnesota State University-Mankato, pursued a career in medical consulting and started a family. By the time Donald Trump was president, Salman, a 35-year-old Burnsville resident, had become conservative.

Salman, who is Somali, believes this trend is gaining traction in his community. That’s because of two things, he argues: Somalis in Minnesota are becoming increasingly middle class and, as Muslims, have always been culturally conservative. Many Muslim voters are also fed up with Democrats taking their votes for granted, Salman said.

“They pimp our vote without giving us anything back,” he said of Democrats. “If you speak to the Muslim community now, they say, ‘This time, I can try conservative.’”

His story isn’t unusual. A day after President Joe Biden’s much maligned performance in the June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump, several East African patrons at the 24 Somali Mall in south Minneapolis expressed support and enthusiasm for Trump.

Many voters say they’re willing to look past Trump’s previous anti-Muslim rhetoric and temporary ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia, during his administration. Immigration from Somalia dropped during Trump’s administration; the United States went from granting 1,797 visas to immigrants from Somalia in 2016 to 464 visas in 2019.

“I used to vote Democrat,” said Mawlid Duale, a truck and Uber driver who is supporting Trump. “But all the issues changed. Everything.”

The idea that voters of color are abandoning Democrats in favor of Republican candidates is a familiar narrative. Political scientists say this trend is overall accurate, but they offer several caveats.

The evidence does show that there has been a shift in preference for Republicans among Black and Latino men since the middle of Trump’s presidency between 2017 and 2021, according to University of Minnesota Political Scientist Christopher Federico. But the shift is marginal, he emphasized, and doesn’t apply to women.

“There does appear to be movement,” he said of voters of color choosing Republican candidates. “It’s real, and it’s modest in size.”

‘We have always had conservative values’

On a recent Friday morning at the Five Star Barbershop inside 24 Somali Mall, owner Yasin Ali lamented slow business at his shop as he cut a lone patron’s hair.

“Look at this barbershop,” Yasin said. “It used to be full. Right now, it’s empty. There’s just one person here.”

Business has been slow for the past few years, and Yasin blamed policies from the Biden administration.

“I will vote for Trump because of the economy,” Yasin said. “Two times I voted Democrat. This will be my first time voting Republican. I want another person in office.”

Biden has frequently touted the economy under his watch, pointing to low unemployment rate and persistent job growth during his term. But his term has also been marred by high inflation and high interest rates from the Federal Reserve, increasing the costs of goods and more.

Sabiq Hirsi, a 26-year-old truck driver, is also planning to vote for Trump in the November 5 general election. Sabiq said business has gone down and gas prices have spiked in the past few years, hurting his bottom line. The cost of living in Minnesota, he said, has gotten too high for his family. He plans to move to Texas later this year.

“Trump is good for business,” Sabiq said.

Sabiq opposes Biden sending U.S. dollars to support Israel in its war against Hamas, and to Ukraine in the ongoing war with Russia.

“Biden is spending billions on wars,” he said. “War wasn’t as crazy when Trump was president.”

He’s also not persuaded by arguments that Trump’s harsh rhetoric on topics like immigration amounts to racism.

“They convinced me the first time when he was running that Trump is a racist and he hates us,” Sabiq said. “Actually, Democrats are bad for the country.”

But it’s not just economic issues that’s driving his vote for Trump. Sabiq has two school-aged sons and said he’s concerned about what they’re taught at school.

“We really don’t have freedom of religion,” he said. “I’m opposed to transgender and LGBT stuff. That’s an issue.”

Several Muslim parents have protested LGBTQ policies and books at Twin Cities schools between late 2022 through 2023.

In December 2022, parents in the Burnsville-Eagan-Savage District expressed concern about a new policy that provided guidelines on supporting transgender students, saying it could potentially conceal information about their children. In the fall of 2023, the parents of up to 200 Muslim students said they might withdraw them from DaVinci Academy in Ham Lake because the school used picture books with LGBTQ characters.

Qudbi Dayib, the president of Dar-Us-Salam Center Mosque, helped to facilitate the Somali Parent Committee meeting at Burnsville schools in December 2022. Qudbi attempted to quell parents’ fears after a mother shared a worksheet with a rainbow on it. Three hundred parents gathered to share their fears about LGBTQ issues in Burnsville schools.

The issue arose again in December 2023 when six Somali families with children in St. Louis Park Public Schools warned they would take “legal recourse” if they were not allowed to opt their children out of LGBTQ picture books. The district eventually allowed parents to opt their children out of such books.

Abshir Muse, owner of Abshir Barbershop at 24 Somali Mall, offered similar cultural reasons for why he’s also planning to vote for Trump. Shortly before conducting their Friday afternoon prayer in a mall hallway, Abshir and three patrons discussed the cultural issues in his barbershop, emphasizing that “a man is a man, a woman is a woman.”

“I have six kids; they go to school,” Abshir said. “They could come back a different way, a different color.”

Abshir said a lot of local Somali voters are leaning Republican because of issues like these.

Salman agrees. With two school-age boys of his own, Salman opposes LGBTQ and gender identity curriculum taught to kids in public schools, which he said is contrary to traditional Muslim values.

“The idea that you can have a different sexual orientation — we feel it is too early for our kids to be indoctrinated with that kind of education,” Salman said. “They can make a decision later on in their life when they are sound.

“As Muslims, we have always had conservative values, and we’ve been all along preaching conservative values that are similar to the Republican Party.”

Marginal growth in Republican support

Salman comes from a politically active family. Many of his relatives acted as clan leaders in Somalia during and after the civil war, resolving financial, criminal and marriage disputes between clan members during a time when the country had no central government. Salman observed with fascination as his family brokered disputes.

He immigrated to the United States in 2007 following the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia, and landed in San Diego. He eventually moved to Minnesota to be near a larger Somali community, and attended college in Mankato at South Central College and eventually Minnesota State University, Mankato, where he obtained a biology degree.

Salman developed an interest in western classics during college, delving into the writings of John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith. This cemented his passion for politics.

He grew more conservative throughout the Obama years, and sometime during Trump’s presidency, he fully converted into a Republican.

Salman believes that changing demographics in the Somali community is prompting more to vote Republican. The first wave of Somali immigrants that arrived in Minnesota in the 1990s were refugees, he said, and historically voted solidly Democratic because they believed the party represented their values. But as their kids grew up and moved up economic ladders, pro-business and pro-entrepreneur perspectives became more attractive to them, he argued.

“The next generation is middle class,” he said. “Their perception has changed because of their economic status, and that plays an important role.”

The data driving the narrative that voters of color are turning conservative largely comes from crosstabs in opinion polls breaking down respondents’ race and gender, which aren’t as reliable as the overall poll sample, said Federico.

There are no statistics specifically for the Somali community, but there is data for other communities of color.

Too often, Federico said, current opinion polls are compared to how people of color voted during the Obama years. That era was a high point for voters of color choosing Democrats, he said, and is not necessarily indicative of how they’ve voted in the long term.

David Schultz, a political science professor at Hamline University, shares that view, noting that President George W. Bush picked up 40 percent of Latino voters’ support in 2004 — the highest for a Republican presidential candidate ever, according to polls.

“There’s a lot of noise out there right now,” Schultz said regarding voters of color voting for Republicans. “And how much of that noise translates into real political behavior, we just don’t know yet.”

For presidential elections over the past 60 years, the percentage of the Black vote for Republican candidates has ranged between 6 and 15 percent. Trump’s support from Black voters grew from 6 percent in 2016 to 8 percent in 2020.

‘I’m hoping they vote for me’

How the Republican vote breaks down in Minnesota’s East African community is unclear. It’s also not clear whether Minnesota’s Republican Party is making efforts to court Somali or East African voters this election, or voters of color in general.

A state party spokesperson did not return emails or phone calls seeking comment. Two years ago, the party hosted a Minnesota Somali Republican Dinner, which attracted a room full of attendees.

Mawlid, the truck and Uber driver, is a regular at 24 Somali Mall. He said the last time he remembers a Republican making real efforts to reach out to the Somali community was former Governor Tim Pawlenty, who’s been out of office for more than a decade. Pawlenty served two terms as governor, and his 2006 reelection marks the last time a Republican candidate won statewide office in Minnesota.

Mawlid said he’s also planning to vote Republican this fall after years of voting for Democrats. He opposes Biden sending U.S. dollars to support Israel and Ukraine.

“All this money is going outside of the country,” he said.

Mawlid in particular is incensed over how Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, whom he previously voted for, vetoed an ordinance last March that would have increased rideshare drivers’ wages in the city.

“Democrats do nothing for our community,” he said.

Mawlid’s friend quickly noted that Republican lawmakers in the Minnesota Legislature also voted against a similar rideshare bill at the state Capitol earlier this year. That’s because Somali people don’t have power in the state Republican Party, Mawlid reasoned.

“If we had power in the Republican Party, then they would have voted for the Uber bill,” Mawlid said. “I am going to vote for Republicans, and then I’m hoping they vote for me.”

Schultz said he doesn’t see evidence of a significant push by the state party to win voters of color, but instead believes that it’s aiming to turn out its base, which is largely rural and white. The state GOP may get a boost from the Trump campaign, which wants to put resources in Minnesota this fall.

But it may be too little, too late for people like Salman, who earlier this year pursued the Republican nomination for a state House of Representatives seat to represent Burnsville. Salman lost the Republican endorsement this spring to Van Holston and did not file for candidacy to challenge him in the August 13 primary.

‘He rubbed us the wrong way’

There’s also the question of whether Trump’s harsh rhetoric on immigration harms his appeal to immigrants. During a 2019 rally in Minneapolis, Trump condemned the legacy of Somali refugee resettlement in Minnesota.

“He’s very racist. He banned all the Muslims,” said Gulad Abdi, referring to the Trump administration travel ban.

Gulad, a regular patron at the 24 Somali Mall, is planning to vote for Biden this fall, although he had concerns about Biden’s performance in the presidential debate, which sparked questions about whether his age was affecting his ability to serve.

“Biden is getting old,” Gulad said. “As a Democrat, I want them to find a new candidate.”

Abdi Mohamed, another regular patron at 24 Somali Mall, said he would also vote for Biden.

“The other guy is a lunatic,” Abdi said of Trump.

Abdi said he does not see support for Trump or Republicans growing among Somali voters.

Some Somali voters say they’re willing to look past Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric. Fatumo Nur voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. She plans to vote for Trump this fall.

“He’s just a noisy guy,” she said. “But he’s not a bad guy.”

Imam Abdirisak Duale, a longtime Republican activist from East Grand Forks, called Trump’s previous remarks about Somalis “unfortunate and divisive.”

“While I may not agree with everything he says, I support many of his policies that prioritize national security, economic growth and religious freedom,” Abdirisak said. “It is important to look at the overall impact of his policies rather than focusing on specific comments.”

Salman added that although Trump’s comments upset many Somali community members, some view it as part of the political game.

“He rubbed us the wrong way,” Salman said, referring to Trump’s statements on Somali refugees. “But I think the majority realize it was a political statement to rally his base.”

The opening came after DFL Representative Hodan Hassan decided not to seek re-election after three terms.

Anquam, (ahn-AHM), 35, is the chief operating officer at Twin Cities Health Services, a substance abuse treatment center and mental health provider in Minneapolis.

Although she’s new to politics, she’s already amassed a long list of endorsements from fellow Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar. She also has the backing of Women Winning, a political organization that recruits and trains pro-choice women to run for office.

Anquam could face at least one challenger during the DFL primary on August 13. Former Minneapolis Park Commissioner Londel French has not yet suspended his campaign. The Minnesota GOP did not respond to an email requesting information about its endorsed candidate in District 62B.

In an interview with Sahan Journal, Anquam talked about her experience growing up in an immigrant household in south Minneapolis, her dream of universal health care in Minnesota, and how serving the most marginalized members of a community can lead to a system that benefits everyone.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Q: Who is Anquam Mahamoud? Tell us more about yourself.

A: I’m Anquam Mahamoud, also known as Deeqa. I was born in San Diego but grew up in South Side Minneapolis after my mother relocated us in 1998. She made the move for a more affordable cost of living and a better education system. As a single mother working overnight shifts in a factory and the [for the] Postal Service, she aimed to provide my three brothers and me with better opportunities and quality education. Being the second oldest and the only girl, I took on responsibilities early on, caring for my younger brothers and managing household duties.

Wanting to alleviate my mother’s financial burden, I started working part-time at 15, earning $5.15 an hour. I used my earnings to cover groceries, school clothes, and supplies for my younger siblings. At this point, it became clear to me that affordable housing was necessary for promoting homeownership and fair wages for all. No child should have to sacrifice their childhood to support their family financially.

My mother emphasized the significance of education for a brighter future, not only for us but also for future generations. She relocated us to Eagan to ensure we had access to better educational opportunities. That was her own way of being an advocate. When I entered college, we returned to south Minneapolis. I successfully graduated from St. Catherine with a degree in psychology.

After graduating in 2012, I faced challenges securing a job right away. A year of unemployment led me to consider applying at local retailers. However, on the very day I decided to submit those applications, I received a call from MNsure.

I started my journey at MNsure in the call center, handling calls from greater Minnesota. It opened my eyes to the difficulties individuals in the Iron Range faced, struggling to submit online applications with dial-up internet. I also heard stories from people whose quality of life was at risk because their insurance didn’t cover necessary procedures or services.

These experiences reinforced my belief that no one should feel powerless due to choosing an insurance plan that falls short in covering future health needs. I strongly advocate for accessible universal health care, believing that the government can take steps to ensure everyone has the health care they need.

In my current position within the administration of a substance treatment center and mental health provider, I directly interact with community members who are grappling with addiction and residing in encampments. Through these experiences, I’ve come to recognize that uplifting our community requires a multifaceted approach. It demands a comprehensive transformation that addresses interconnected issues at their roots, providing holistic support to those in need.

Q: What inspired you to run for the Minnesota House 62B seat?

A: I’ve chosen to run for the MN House 62B seat, driven by a deep desire to make a positive impact in my community. While opportunities to run for other positions arose before, I focused on advocacy, undergoing training with Isaiah, and participating in their leadership development program. Working with Isaiah exposed me to diverse perspectives, highlighting the challenges our country faces and emphasizing the importance of authentic representation for systematic change.

Now, I’m running because I believe I’m prepared to shoulder the responsibility and confident in my ability to effectively serve the community. My experience in implementing the Affordable Care Act for the state has equipped me with the skills needed to address the issues our community is facing. I am determined to bring about the changes that our community needs and desires in the House.

Q: What specific issues do you plan to prioritize if elected?

A: If elected, my primary focus will be on guaranteeing that every member of our community has access to essential services crucial to their well-being and success. Foremost among my priorities is championing the implementation of universal health care, as nobody should face the dilemma of picking between their health and financial stability.

Moreover, I will exert unwavering efforts to guarantee that our education system delivers quality education to all, irrespective of ZIP code or socioeconomic status. This means advocating for fair and equitable funding, providing robust support for teachers, and investing in programs that cater to the diverse needs of our students.

Additionally, if elected as state representative, I pledge to prioritize economic development in our community. I want to create an economy that favors everyone instead of the wealthy. I will keep my focus on job creation, supporting small businesses, and, most of all, implementing policies that promote workers’ rights, fair wages, and overall economic stability for working families.

Q: Explain more what you mean by implementing universal health care. Would that be an expansion of MinnesotaCare? What groups are falling through the cracks now?

A: Health care is a basic human right. In the richest country on Earth, nobody should worry about attaining or paying for the health care they need. I believe that your health care should not be dependent upon employment, income, or immigration status. Universal care would look like a health care for all or single-payer health care system like the Minnesota Health Plan proposed by DFL Senator John Marty such that no one suffers financial hardship by seeking care, plain and simple.

This would ensure that dental care, prescription drugs, optometry, mental health services, chemical dependency treatment, medical equipment and supplies, home care services, and nursing home care is covered.

Deductibles, premiums, prescription drug prices, and out-of-pocket costs are high and out of control, leading to our residents not being able to afford their care. Those that are most likely to fall through the cracks are low-income households, Black, Indigenous and Latine communities — and these residents are also most likely to report “forgone care.” It is these communities that stand to benefit most from such a model.

Q: What is one example of a targeted initiative or policy you would support to address the needs of underserved communities in your district?

A: Some of our most underserved community members are our unhoused neighbors. I think we all can agree that no one chooses this path, and there are huge barriers that manifest when working towards housing someone who is chronically homeless. We need sustained, targeted funding in this area and people who understand these challenges in St. Paul; I work with our unhoused neighbors in rehabilitative mental health and substance use disorder treatment. We meet residents where they are and together we dismantle barriers to housing, recovery, and health access.

I would like to see us fund local, culturally specific providers; deeply affordable, low-barrier housing and intentional shelter space like a Minneapolis tiny indoor village (Avivo Village) on the South Side; and work closely with the city of Minneapolis and Hennepin County to bring these to fruition in a safe and collaborative way. This will bring healing, care, and understanding to our communities.

I also have heard a strong desire to close Smith Foundry in East Phillips, and allow for a just transition for its workers. I support a targeted funding initiative to buy out this polluter of one of our most diverse working-class residential neighborhoods as well as legislation that would give more tools for cities to address these types of actors in the future.

Q: What is an issue where you would reach across the aisle if elected?

A: Climate change is the greatest threat of our time, and quite frankly we do not have time for arguing about the science — which is backed by nearly all climate scientists and the entire academic community. I feel it is crucial, however, that DFL legislators work across the aisle to bring these immediate, existential concerns to both Republican allies and even deniers alike. In doing so, we can make sure we are working as one to pass things like the broadly popular “Prove It First” legislation so we protect the Boundary Waters from toxic polluters and keep us on track to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 in the state.

Every Minnesotan, no matter the party, wants clean water and clean air. Uniting around this issue is of critical importance. The lives of our kids and future generations depend on it.

‘Disrespectful’: Calls for an apology after Hmong legislators rushed off stage during Asian Pacific Islander Day,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/disrespectful-calls-for-an-apology-after-hmong-legislators-rushed-off-stage-during-asian-pacific-islander-day/,2024-04-26,"Hibah Ansari, More Hibah Ansari, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/resized-photos-2024-04-26T123203.210.jpg,"A community petition is calling for a public apology from the state’s Council on Asian Pacific Minnesotans after its chair attempted to rush a group of Hmong elected officials off stage at a recent event.

The council, a non-cabinet agency in the executive branch of the state government, hosted Asian Pacific Islander (API) Day at the Minnesota Capitol on April 3. No Asian and Pacific Islander legislators were on the program, but Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy brought two state senators, Susan Pha and Foung Hawj, on stage with her. When they also brought two additional members of the Minnesota Asian Pacific Caucus on stage, Representatives Ethan Cha and Kaohly Vang Her, Pha was interrupted by the council’s board chair, Saraswati Singh.

The incident came in the wake of a disagreement that surfaced at a legislative committee hearing the previous week over how best to commemorate the beginnings of Minnesota’s Southeast Asian communities 50 years ago.

After Hawj gave his speech, Singh is seen in a recording of the event on stage telling the group that they are taking up time from other speakers. Pha continued her speech. After they left the stage, Singh called out the legislators for bringing additional guests on the stage who were not on the agenda.

“Of all the legislators who spoke, our [Asian Pacific Islander] legislators were the only ones that were interrupted while we spoke, told to get off the stage, and also told that we were not invited,” said Pha in a video posted on Facebook a day after the event.

Pha added in her Facebook post that she requested the 10 Asian Pacific Islander members of the state legislature get a chance to speak at the event, but she was refused. The event also included a ceremonial opening with local Thai monks, speeches from Governor Tim Walz, community leaders, other state legislators, and a colonel from the National Guard.

The council’s former executive director Lee Pao Xiong is among more than 200 people petitioning for an apology from the council.

“That was very unprofessional,” Xiong said. “The state Legislature created you, and your role is to advise the governor and state legislature on issues affecting your respective communities. The API legislators have every right to be there in front of their constituents.”

After Pha and Hawj accompanied Murphy onstage, Hawj first addressed the audience and then passed the mic to Pha. As Pha approached the podium, the council’s board chair Saraswati Singh appeared on stage. Singh moderated the event.

“Senator Pha, you’re taking up other people’s time, please,” Singh said as she gestured for Pha to follow her off the stage.

“Let her finish, she’ll be brief,” Murphy said. She appears to offer her own speaking time to Pha.

“How many seconds?” Singh responded, as Pha began her speech.

In a written statement to Sahan Journal, Pha said the chair’s actions were “unnecessary and highly disrespectful.”

“It’s reminiscent of the trauma we dealt with, and continue to deal with when excluded from spaces we are told we don’t belong,” Pha said.

Once Pha ended her speech, Singh came back on stage to continue the program.

“We had three people up on stage and then two other people jumped in. They did not have permission to do so. They’re not on our agenda,” Singh said. She then named the two additional representatives.

“We think it’s really important to go with our theme of ‘We the People,’” Singh said. “I want to make sure, and the council wants to make sure, that this is not just about elected officials, this is about you and community leaders.”

The Council on Asian Pacific Minnesotans did not respond to requests for comment after the event.

The council works with the governor, Legislature, state agencies, and community organizations to boost economic, social, legal, and political equality of Asian Pacific residents of Minnesota. Members are appointed by the governor and include state legislators.

Hawj, Cha, and Her also declined interview requests from Sahan Journal.

Event sparks outrage on social media

A petition has been circulating within the Hmong American Political Action Network group on Facebook calling for a formal apology from Singh, as well as an investigation into the integrity of the Council on Asian Pacific Minnesotans.

“This incident, marked by an apparent lack of respect and recognition towards AAPI legislators by the Council’s leadership, is deeply troubling,” the petition says. “Their actions have significantly eroded the trust, credibility, and confidence of the AAPI community and the AAPI legislators.”

Representative Kaohly Vang Her, one of the legislators who joined Pha and Hawj on stage at API Day, posted photos from a rally the following day and said it’s unfortunate that the council “gate keeps who gets to be heard, seen, and on stage.”

“When I speak at rallies and events I bring up all of my colleagues in attendance,” Her’s post says. “Why? Because this work isn’t about me. Nothing gets done because of one person. I want the people, ‘We the People’ to see the collective of who is fighting hard everyday for them.”

St. Paul City Council Member Nelsie Yang shared Pha’s response in a Facebook post and said the council’s operations need “re-evaluation.”

“It’s time to appoint people into these seats who will be effective both in community and at the Capitol, especially with API folks. Also, they need to have basic respect for others,” Yang said on Facebook.

Disagreements over bill led up to the event

A tense discussion of a bill preceded API Day at the State Capitol. The House Legacy Finance Committee met a week before the event to discuss a bill sponsored by Representative Liz Lee to celebrate 50 years of Hmong and Southeast Asian communities in Minnesota.

The bill would have appropriated $300,000 to commemorate 50 years of Southeast Asians in Minnesota through grants to community organizations. It also would have funded $200,000 to the Minnesota Historical Society for programs celebrating the arrival of the first Hmong family in Minnesota in October 1975.

Singh was one of six individuals who testified against the bill, saying it focused on the Hmong community and did not include the Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Laotian communities, as well as Vietnam War veterans. Community leaders from the Coalition of Asian American Leaders and the Vietnamese Social Services testified in support of the bill at the committee meeting. The bill is still being discussed in the state House.

“I believe in diversity, equity, and inclusion. It’s really important to me because I’ve been a minority my whole life,” said Singh, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants. “We’re all used to not having our voice heard in government. We’re used to being ‘other.’ We’re also used to being pitted against other community groups.”

Her also spoke in the committee meeting in support of the bill and said that the Minnesota Asian Pacific legislative caucus heard from the Hmong community that it wanted its own celebration.

She said Lee’s bill offers the flexibility to hold multiple celebrations.

Xiong said the intent of the bill was to enable a community-led commemoration, rather than one that was hosted by the council or the state.

He added that Hmong community members who work at the Capitol have told him that the council has repeatedly opposed many of their legislative initiatives. The tension on stage may have been a result of that opposition, Xiong said.

The petition calls for the governor’s office to take action since many of the council members are appointed by the governor.

“The community is in shock,” Xiong said. “Everything comes down to the governor’s office. The community is waiting to see what the governor is going to do.”

University of Minnesota students vow to rally for Palestine until school divests from Israel,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/university-of-minnesota-palestine-rally-divestment-israel/,2024-04-24,"Myah Goff, Katrina Pross, More Myah Goff, More Katrina Pross, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_2343.jpeg,"Several dozen University of Minnesota students staged a die-in and more than 150 gathered for a rally Wednesday at Memorial Coffman Union, calling for the university to divest from organizations they say support Israel.

The move comes after nine people, including several students, were arrested by University of Minnesota police Tuesday for setting up an encampment on campus supporting Palestine.

Gina-Isabella Zedan, a sophomore of Egyptian descent, joined Wednesday’s rally after feeling inspired by the large number of demonstrators who turned out Tuesday after the police action.

“I just wanted to be a part of it,” she said. “It’s really beautiful to see all these people come in support, even people who aren’t Muslim.”

Protesters staged a die-in around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday on the first floor of Coffman by lying on the ground to symbolize those killed in Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in the area. The conflict began last October when Hamas attacked Israel from the Gaza Strip.

Students filled the hallways as around 30 protestors sprawled across the floor. “UMN, stop your hiding!” the protesters chanted. “While you’re silent, children are dying!”

The chants intensified as a speaker urged the crowd to be louder: “They need to hear you. We need to disrupt!”

Nicole Moberg, a student who participated in the die-in, emphasized that the Palestinian plight is a matter of human rights rather than politics.

“It’s not an anti-Semitic issue; it’s a human rights issue,” she said.

Students later rallied outside Coffman, chanting, “Protesting is not a crime!” and “UMN, you can’t hide! We charge you with genocide!” Some passersby paused to take in the scene, others hurried past the sea of signs that read, “Divest from Genocide” and “Hands off our protest, pigs.”

Merlin Van Alstine, a member of Students for Democratic Society, warned those who planned to resurrect an encampment on campus.

“This is an arrestable action as we’ve seen,” Alstine said, referring to Tuesday’s incident. “If and when the police come and give a dispersal order, please leave, and if you’re able to, help pack up.”

Tuesday’s encampment and Wednesday’s events were organized by the student groups Students for Justice in Palestine and Students for a Democratic Society , among others, mirroring similar action at universities across the country like Columbia University, Yale University, and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt.

University of Minnesota students said they continued demonstrating Wednesday because they felt unheard by university leadership.

“Our demands aren’t being met,” said Iman Khemakhem, a member of Students for a Democratic Society. “We were forced to take this action.”

Nine people were arrested at the university Tuesday after demonstrators set up tents on Northrop Mall about 4 a.m. to show solidarity with Gaza and Palestine.

University spokesman Jake Ricker said in a statement that university police arrived at Northrop Mall shortly after 6 a.m. Tuesday, and told protestors that they were violating a university policy and state trespassing law. Police told demonstrators they would be arrested if they didn’t disperse by 7 a.m.

The university’s policy says rallies, demonstrations and gatherings of less than 100 people are allowed on Northrop Mall without a permit. But a permit is required if tents are displayed outside.

“In addition, Public Safety has not allowed any encampments, tents, fires, or other types of encampment living arrangements on any University properties or in buildings,” Ricker said.

Tents and supplies were confiscated. Some participants dispersed, but nine remained and were arrested. Ricker said he believes that seven of the demonstrators arrested were students, one was a university employee, and that one had no known affiliation with the school.

The people arrested Tuesday were issued civil trespass warnings; students and the university employee will have their warnings “set aside” so they can work and attend classes on campus, Ricker said.

“So many vehicles and cops started circulating the entire campus. We were like, OK, we need to pack up all of these things and we need to disperse immediately,” said Khemakhem, who participated in Tuesday’s demonstration. “This is not something that we’re prepared for. This action was so militarized where we realized it’s just not safe to be on campus right now.”

Over 300 students staged a walkout Tuesday afternoon following the arrests. Hundreds of people protested that evening outside of Coffman Memorial Union, and another encampment was set up later that day.

U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., attended the Tuesday evening protest to support demonstrators.

“I am incredibly moved by your courage and bravery as a student body in putting your bodies on the line to stand in solidarity to end the genocide that is taking place in Gaza at this moment,” Omar said to protestors.

University police approached the encampment around 11 p.m. Tuesday, and told demonstrators to disperse. All participants removed structures and tents, and left the area. No arrests were made.

“The police presence is very unprecedented, and their excessive use of force is blatant discrimination,” said Adam Abu, outreach manager for Students for Justice in Palestine.

He said his group’s main demand is for the university to divest from companies like Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, and General Dynamics, which the group believes profit from the Israel-Hamas conflict.

“We’ll continue camping out until we hear something from the president, and until they say yes on the divestment,” said Maya Hamid, a member of Students for Justice in Palestine.

The actions supporting Palestine come as some students celebrate the Jewish holiday, Passover, which began at sundown Monday. The student group, Minnesota Hillel, released a statement expressing concern about rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas conflict.

“The eliminationist rhetoric being spewed on campuses since then has been toxic, and sometimes unsafe,” said an Instagram post by Minnesota Hillel. “The messages around campus, in the classroom, and on social media have marginalized, demonized, and eliminated the majority of Jewish voices, and isolated and targeted Jewish students.”

Sami Rahamim, a spokesman for the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas, said protesters at the University of Minnesota and across the country are using language that is pro-terrorism, which many Jewish people find disturbing.

“It’s not safe to be visibly Jewish in many places on campus,” Rahamim said. “That should not be where we’re at in 2024.”

Rahamim said he’s concerned that upcoming graduation ceremonies could be jeopardized if protests continue. There have been no indications that students or others plan to demonstrate at local graduation ceremonies.

Ricker said the university has experience managing demonstrations at events, and has plans in place to address them.

“While the University supports free speech, ensuring these students can be properly celebrated for their achievements and that they and their families have a safe and accessible experience is our top priority,” said Ricker’s written statement."
Minnesota bill aimed at preserving Black families would now cover most of state’s foster kids,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/child-welfare-minnesota-legislature-african-american-family-preservation-act/,2024-04-04,"Alex Perez, More Alex Perez, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/F5A2921-1.jpg,"This story is being co-published with The Imprint, a national nonprofit news outlet covering child welfare and youth justice.

Since 2018, advocates for Black children and families and a succession of Minnesota lawmakers have fought for legislation that would correct one of the glaring disparities in the child welfare system: the disproportionate number of child maltreatment investigations, foster care removals and terminations of parental rights targeting African Americans.

The motivation for the bill — and frustration surrounding its long struggle to gain traction in the Legislature — was in full view at a legislative hearing in St. Paul on March 21. In a heated exchange, Kelis Houston, a longtime advocate for the African American Family Preservation Act, spoke determinedly, as the committee chair, Representative Dave Pinto, DFL-St. Paul, tried in vain to shush her.

“You have heard years of testimony, you’ve seen our parents crying, our children harmed, you’ve witnessed the trauma,” Houston, the founder of the nonprofit Village Arms, implored members of the House Children and Families Finance and Policy Committee. “You can stay calm because it’s not your children.”

Later, seated alongside Houston, bill author Representative Esther Agbaje, DFL-Minneapolis, spoke tearfully.

“We deserve that opportunity to ensure that all of our communities that have been harmed by the United States have the opportunity to thrive,” Agbaje said. “The pain is real and palpable here, but part of the legislative process is to move it along so we can continue to have those conversations.”

After a hearing lasting more than an hour, Agbaje’s bill received unanimous support, and is now headed to the House judiciary committee. But the amended version goes well beyond the original intent of protecting Black children of African origin. The current version of the legislation broadens protections to all “African American and disproportionately represented children” — a group so large it encompasses nearly all children currently in foster care.

A higher standard

As currently drafted, the bill would require child welfare agencies to make “active efforts” to prevent family separation for any child “whose race, culture, ethnicity, disability status, or low-income socioeconomic​ status is disproportionately encountered, engaged, or identified in the child welfare system​ as compared to the representation in the state’s total child population.​”

The legislation aims to prevent “arbitrary and unnecessary removal” of these children from their families and improve family reunification rates. At every stage of a case, social service agencies would be held accountable for considering an African American or disproportionately represented family’s “social and cultural values.” Agencies would also have to make “active efforts” to prevent out-of-home placements, and return children to parents as quickly as possible.

Under current law, a lower legal standard of “reasonable efforts” is applied in virtually all cases.

An exception is made for children who are members of Native American tribes or who are eligible for tribal membership. They are covered under an active efforts provision of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.

Active efforts — rather than the lower standard of reasonable efforts — are considered to be a central tenet of the landmark ICWA law. The standard means Indigenous children’s relatives and close kin must be prioritized for foster care placements, and their parents provided greater opportunity to reunify with their kids than typically occurs in child welfare cases, among other special provisions.

ICWA passed in 1978 as an agreement between nations: the U.S. government and sovereign tribes, who have jurisdiction over their citizens in foster care cases.

Agbaje’s bill applies that same standard to other children who appear disproportionately in foster care, making the ”gold standard” of child welfare law enacted under ICWA apply to nearly all kids and families.

“Active efforts sets a higher standard for the responsible social services agency than reasonable efforts to preserve the child’s family, prevent the child’s out-of-home placement, and reunify the child with the child’s family,” her bill states.

If enacted, Minnesota would become the first state in the nation to raise the ICWA-established “active efforts” standard to virtually all foster children. But the proposed law states clearly that it is not meant to undermine existing law that protects tribal children.

“Nothing in this legislation is intended to interfere with the protections of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978,” it reads.

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Human Services said the state “remains deeply concerned about the pattern of disproportionate placements for African American children in Minnesota and supports efforts to eliminate those disparities.” The department is providing technical assistance on Agbaje’s bill “to ensure if enacted it can be implemented effectively by local child welfare agencies, and is aligned with federal laws governing foster care and permanency.”

The email went on to note: “We still have considerable work ahead. Our vision for child and family well-being means reducing racial disparities so all Minnesota families can thrive.”

Stacy Hennen, director of human services for Western Prairie and a representative of the Minnesota Association of County Social Service Administrators, said local leaders “are very concerned about the disparities that exist for African American children and Native American children in our system.” Solutions, she added, require reforms at every stage of the child welfare system.

Regarding the pending legislation, Hennan said: “In concept, and in theory, we 100% support some of the changes that are being called for in the bill.”

Stark disparities

In March, racial discrimination against Black children in Minnesota was called out by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the New York-based advocacy group Children’s Rights. The nonprofits are calling on the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to investigate.

“The State has failed to remedy the historic and ongoing harms caused by its child welfare system,” the 30-page complaint states, “and the discrimination against and disparate impacts upon Minnesota’s Black families have been egregious and shocking.”

Houston’s Village Arms nonprofit focuses on family preservation and reunification through parenting education, in-home visits, advocacy and direct assistance. Diversions from the CPS system are vital, Houston and others fighting against the separation of Black families say. They point to statistics showing disparate treatment at every stage of the Minnesota foster care system.

In Hennepin County, where Black people comprise 15% of the population, they are the subject of 37% of child maltreatment reports.

Even more stark are the numbers of households investigated for parental abuse and neglect — the “front door” of the child welfare system. When reports are made to the child protection hotline, 60% of cases involving Black children are investigated, compared with 39% for white children, said Rep. Agbaje.

According to a disproportionality index produced each year by the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, only white and Asian children are underrepresented in Minnesota foster care, compared with their presence in the general population. Over-represented groups include Black children, who appear in foster care at 1.24 times their population rate, and mixed-race children, at a rate of nearly four times. By contrast, Native American children in Minnesota appear in foster care at 14 times their rate in the population.

Pinto, chair of the children and families committee, pointed to an initial analysis of Agbaje’s pending bill by the Association of Minnesota Counties, which estimated that as many as 90% of all foster children fall into some category of disproportionate representation. That means they would be eligible for active efforts protections under the pending bill.

Active efforts translate to greater supportive services offered to parents struggling with addiction, mental health or domestic violence, and prioritizing relatives and close kin over foster parents unknown to the child. Under the proposed law, parental rights could not be terminated “solely on the parent’s failure to complete case plan requirements.”

Onlookers say the bill, which will be heard April 9 in the House Judiciary Finance and Civil Law Committee, faces significant challenges to becoming law.

In an email, Pinto told The Imprint “that there do continue to be a number of concerns with the bill.” But he noted, “as I also said during the hearing, the disparities in child welfare are certainly a big concern; we’ll continue to look at ways to address them.”

‘Racism. Point blank.’

An earlier version of the African American Family Preservation Act passed the state House in 2021 before stalling in the Senate. The current version has been renamed the Layla Jackson Law, after a 17-month-old Black infant who was killed in 2018 by a white foster parent in a home where court documents state she was “racially harassed,” and “mocked” before being beaten to death.

Representative Nathan Coulter, DFL-Bloomington, said the bill in its current form raised “a broader question about how the child welfare system works and what we can and should be doing about it.” He closed his statements by saying: “We have to think about not only the cost of doing this, but the cost of not doing this. The status quo is not acceptable.”

Those who have examined the bill language have raised questions about the constitutionality of creating higher standards for some children and not others, and how eligibility would be determined for children who are not members of tribes.

“Even though we’re putting disproportionality in the bill, Black children are still at the bottom of that disproportionality list, and we want to make sure we make that clear,” said Thomas Berry, program director for the St. Paul-based Black Civic Network. Berry, who is co-chair of the local NAACP’s child protection committee, has advocated for the bill in its various forms since its first introduction in 2018.

After a frustrating day in the Capitol — in which three sergeants-at-arms were summoned to restore “decorum” — Houston told The Imprint what she sees as the obstacle that lies ahead.

“Racism. Point blank,” she said. “There’s no other way to frame or even talk about it.”

The pain in the room

During the March 21 committee meeting, Representative Heather Keeler, a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, described concerns that she and her tribal elders had about the African American Family Preservation Act.

Native people are eligible for ICWA as citizens of sovereign nations within the United States, and “we hold a politically protected class that others don’t,” said Keeler, DFL-Moorhead.

Still, the fight to preserve ICWA has intensified in recent years, with a case reaching the Supreme Court challenging its constitutionality. Brackeen v. Haaland was brought by white couples seeking to adopt Indigenous children, including a Minnesota family. They argued, unsuccessfully, that the law was race-based and thus discriminated against them as white people.

The recent challenge to ICWA was averted, but nonetheless struck fear among tribal leaders and supporters nationwide.

“You do not want your children caught up in the Supreme Court under constitutionality issues,” Keeler advised at the hearing. “It’s a horrible place to be.”

Black family advocate Houston responded in frustration to this at the recent legislative hearing.

“This body has done a lot for the Native American community, but it has done nothing for the African American community,” she said. “If you cared about Black children instead of arguing about constitutionality, you’d be listening to our experiences.”

As the hearing drew to a close, Representative María Isa Pérez-Vega, DFL-St. Paul, took time at the lectern to acknowledge the pain in the room, and called for common understanding.

“There’s tensions, emotion and pain — and we’re carrying the generations of pain,” Pérez-Vega said.

She introduced herself as “a single mom to a child that has every drop of blood of ethnicity,” and someone with a blended background.

“I’m Indigenous, I’m African, I‘m European, I’m as Puerto Rican as it could get,” Pérez-Vega said. “This place is painful, these circles and conversations are re-traumatizing and — with all due respect Mr. Chair and members of this committee — we’re loud because we’ve been crying for a long time.”"
What Minnesota’s ‘stunning’ uncommitted turnout in Democratic primary means for the November election,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/minnesota-democratic-primary-uncommitted-vote-biden-protest-gaza-ceasefire/,2024-03-06,"Joey Peters, Katrina Pross, Cynthia Tu, More Joey Peters, More Katrina Pross, More Cynthia Tu, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PrimaryVoting2024-2671.jpg,"Minnesota made national waves in the Democratic Party presidential primary Tuesday as voters rejected President Joe Biden at the highest rate of any state so far this election year.

Nearly 46,000 of the state’s Democratic voters marked “uncommitted” on their ballots instead of Biden, making up 19 percent of all Democrats who turned out at the polls Tuesday. The strong turnout shocked political analysts, and organizers who urged Democrats to reject the president because of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

It also raised questions about whether the ripple effect could hand Republicans an advantage in the presidential election and state legislative races this fall.

“I was completely flabbergasted and elated by the results,” said Hassan Abdel Salam, a Minnesota member of the Abandon Biden national coalition. “It was 10 times the number that I felt was significant to redeem the strategy that we began in October.”

The push for uncommitted votes in the Democratic primary is a national campaign, with a number of Minnesotans getting involved beyond state borders. Michigan had the second highest percentage of uncommitted Democratic voters in the country, with just over 13%. North Carolina was third with just under 13%, and Massachusetts came in fourth with 9%.

Salam believes the results could make Minnesota a swing state in the November 5 general election.

Asma Mohammed, the lead organizer of Uncommitted Minnesota, which also pushed for Democratic voters to reject Biden, shared in Salam’s surprise. Uncommitted Minnesota and Abandon Biden are separate campaigns that urged Minnesotans to vote uncommitted, but have different strategies for the November 5 general election.

“I didn't expect it, but I'm really proud of the work that we did to show Palestinians that we have not forgotten them and that we will not stop until we have a ceasefire,” Mohammed said.

The Minnesota Democratic Farmer-Labor Party stayed largely silent about Tuesday’s uncommitted votes, instead emphasizing that Biden won 70%, or 171,260, of Minnesota’s Democratic primary voters.

Uncommitted votes finished second behind the president, with Minnesota Representative Dean Phillips coming in at a distant third with about 8% of the votes.

Biden has won every state primary so far, and is easily on his way to lock up his party’s presidential nomination. Former President Donald Trump has led the Republican primary, and is presumed to be his party’s nominee after challenger Nikki Haley dropped out of the race Wednesday morning.

“President Biden’s overwhelming victories in Minnesota and across the country show that our party is uniting to defend our democracy from Donald Trump,” DFL Chair Ken Martin said in a prepared statement. “The DFL will leave nothing on the table to keep Minnesota blue in this existential election.”

Martin added that uncommitted voters ""wanted their voices to be heard, and participating in our presidential primary is the right way to do that.""

""That message is being recognized, and President Biden is working to end the brutality in Gaza,"" Martin said. ""We think the vast majority of these voters will understand the existential threat that Donald Trump poses to our democracy and will help us prevent him from returning to the White House. We will not take our base for granted in this election and we’ll work hard to earn every vote.”

‘People showed that they are really serious’

The strength of the uncommitted vote also shocked political pundits and analysts in the state, who say the result has implications for the general election.

Former state Senator Jeff Hayden, a Democrat who used to represent part of south Minneapolis, noted that uncommitted votes outnumbered Biden votes in his old district. The district, which is reliably progressive, is an important vote for Democrats in any statewide election, Hayden said.

“Yesterday, people showed that they are really serious about getting his attention,” Hayden said.

Hayden, who voted for Biden in the primary, said he understands why voters chose uncommitted, and emphasized that they are sending a loud message to the president.

Uncommitted Minnesota hoped the uncommitted votes would convince the president to call for a permanent ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.

Biden’s reelection chances hinge on support of the progressive base that voted uncommitted, Hayden said, and to do so he must start using the U.S. government’s power “to de-escalate what is going on in Israel.” That would include a ceasefire and sending humanitarian aid to Gaza, he said.

Hayden said he is concerned about the violence in the Middle East, but is also “terrified” of a second Trump administration, which he said could turn into a “revenge term” to get back at people opposed to him, including those who prosecuted and indicted him.

Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, called the amount of uncommitted votes “stunning,” especially for an effort that mobilized quickly.

“Whether it's a candidate or an issue, these things usually have weeks and hundreds of thousands of dollars behind them, and this had neither, and it had the largest support in the country so far by some margin,” he said.

Jacobs said that 19% of votes going toward uncommitted in Minnesota sends a big message to Biden, and he expects that Biden will have to make changes to his policies concerning Israel’s war in Gaza.

“He runs a risk of not winning if he continues in the current path,” Jacobs said.

If fewer Democrats vote in the November election because they don’t support Biden, Jacobs said, that could mean that some House seats in the Minnesota Legislature could flip, particularly in suburban areas. Democrats currently control the governor's office, the House of Representatives, and the Senate, which has allowed the Legislature to pass significant progressive reforms.

“That will come to a screeching halt if the Republicans win the majority in the House,” Jacobs said. “And if this uncommitted vote turns out to be a sign of a voter boycott in the November election, it’s going to be harder for the DFL to hold the majority in the House.”

The uncommitted votes also signal to the DFL that Muslim voters in the state can’t be ignored, he added. The local effort was led by high-profile leaders, including Minneapolis City Council Vice President Aisha Chughtai, St. Paul City Council President Mitra Jalai, and Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

“They need to pay more attention to Muslim voters. We can't take them for granted, that they’re a political force, that they are well organized, that there's strong turnout for issues and candidates,” Jacobs said. “This was a major event, and I think it will be registered in the political lexicon as a kind of a marker.”

In Minneapolis, Wards 9 and 10 had the highest percentages of uncommitted votes, with about 55% and 56%, respectively. Those wards include the Corcoran, Powderhorn Park, Whittier, and Lowry Hill East neighborhoods, among others. Ward 13 around Lake Harriet and the southern tip of Bde Maka Ska in southwest Minneapolis had the lowest percentage of uncommitted votes in the city, with nearly 19%.

In St. Paul, the highest concentration of uncommitted votes were in Wards 1 and 4, which include the Hamline-Midway, Frogtown, and Summit-University neighborhoods, among others. About 34% of Democratic voters in each ward were uncommitted. Ward 3, which encompasses the Highland Park neighborhood, had the lowest percentage of uncommitted votes in St. Paul, with about 22%.

Hennepin County led the state with about 25% of voters checking uncommitted on their ballots. Ramsey County followed at 23%, with Rice County coming in third at 22%. Outstate counties where uncommitted votes gained traction included Olmsted County and St. Louis County at 16% and 15%, respectively.

Tuesday’s primary saw a lower overall turnout for Democratic voters compared to Republicans. Jacobs said that is likely because there wasn’t competition on the Democratic ballot.

“There was really no race here, which makes the uncommitted vote even more impressive,” Jacobs said. “These are not casual voters. It's the people who were highly motivated.”

The results mean that the uncommitted vote won 11 of 97 delegates who will attend the Democratic Party national convention later this year. Party delegates ultimately decide who becomes the party’s nominee for president, and the vast majority are pledged to Biden.

The uncommitted effort grew out of disapproval of Biden’s support and taxpayer-funding of the Israel-Hamas war. More than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the conflict started last October, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Organizers behind the local effort said two key groups drove the uncommitted turnout in Minnesota: Muslims and progressives, especially those from Generation Z.

“This is not a Muslim issue,” said Mohammed, the organizer with Uncommitted Minnesota. “This is an issue that spans across faiths, across generations, across races.”

Salam, who is also an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota, said it stood out that more uncommitted voters turned out proportionally in Minnesotan than in Michigan’s primary last week.

Michigan’s uncommitted push, which Salam was a part of, took weeks of organizing and triple the effort, he said, while most of the Minnesota organizing happened within the last week. In the end, 13% of Democratic primary voters in Michigan marked uncommitted compared to Minnesota’s 19%, though the number of Michigan’s uncommitted voters exceeded 100,000 people. Many more people voted overall in Michigan.

“I thought it would be exceptional if we matched Michigan, and we really outdid them,” Salam said. “It was a thrilling night.”

Mohammed said that in the past week, the uncommitted campaign made thousands of calls and knocked on doors in areas with Muslim voters and in areas with many non-English speakers. The campaign in Minnesota is in touch with other states, and is helping to push their message nationally, she said.

Different strategies ahead

On primary day, several uncommitted Democratic voters said they had varying plans for this fall’s general election.

The Abandon Biden effort will push for a Biden defeat in November, Salam said, even if that helps Trump win. Uncommitted Minnesota, however, wouldn’t go that far, saying instead that its focus is on pushing Biden to declare a permanent ceasefire, and on using its delegates to influence policy at the Democratic National Convention this summer.

“We are going to make sure that our delegates are on message and that we are talking about the genocide of Palestinians and how the U.S. and President Biden had a significant part in that,” Mohammed said. “I think that our role will be ensuring that President Biden is a better nominee, and that we put our best foot forward in November.”

Biden is winning primaries across the country, Salam said, which means that his pledged delegates will vastly outnumber the influence of any uncommitted delegates.

“The only thing that stops him from becoming the nominee is himself,” Salam said. “He has no reason to step down if he’s looking at these numbers. Our number of delegates will be miniscule.”

Mohammed, on the other hand, said that if the effort succeeds in getting Biden to call for a permanent ceasefire, “that would be incredible.”

“We will still keep pressure on him to remove weapons from Israel. But immediate ceasefire is our biggest goal,” she said. “And until that happens, we will continue the pressure nationally to make sure that he knows that his presidency is at stake.""

For Salam, a Biden call for ceasefire would be too little, too late to earn his support or change the course of the Abandon Biden campaign. He emphasized that he was part of a coalition of activists who gave Biden a November 1, 2023, deadline to declare a ceasefire to keep their support.

“We made a vow and we will keep our word,” Salam said. “I recall one of our co-chairs in Michigan saying, ‘I will vote for Biden in November if he declares a ceasefire as long as he revives and resurrects every lost life.’”

As for whether the overall effort leads to a Trump presidency again, Salam said the effort is worth the risk, even if he finds Trump “detestable.” He hopes that in the long run, a defeat for Biden would lead the way to “a new Democratic Party where it’s understood that there’s a red line, like the way that Republicans think of abortion.”

Mohammed said Biden needs to act soon to ensure reelection.

“If the president has not called for a ceasefire by November, I think that he will have lost a significant part of the party,” she said."
‘Uncommitted’ voters hope ‘domino effect’ in primaries will shock Biden into action on Israel-Hamas war,https://sahanjournal.com/democracy-politics/abandon-biden-uncommitted-vote-minnesota-primary/,2024-03-05,"Joey Peters, More Joey Peters, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar, Where Img, Height Auto Max-Width, Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PrimaryVoting2024-2612.jpg,"Twenty-year-old Taslima Aboubaker cast her first vote ever in a presidential race Tuesday.

Her choice? “Uncommitted.”

Taslima, who is Muslim, voted “uncommitted” on the Democratic-Farm-Laborer (DFL) ballot in Tuesday’s presidential primary election because she disagrees with President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. She hopes her vote will persuade the president to call for a permanent ceasefire after losing support in primary elections across the country.

“Hopefully it causes a domino effect that the president can’t ignore,” said Taslima, who voted at the Brian Coyle Center in Minneapolis’ Cedar-Riverside neighborhood.

Taslima was swayed by the national Abandon Biden campaign, which is being led locally by high-profile Muslim leaders, including a University of Minnesota professor and leaders from the local chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Some local politicians, including Minneapolis City Council Vice President Aisha Chughtai and St. Paul City Council President Mitra Jalai, have also urged voters to mark “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary.

Biden’s support of Israel’s war against Hamas prompted the backlash from his own base. More than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the conflict started last October, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Taslima paid close attention to the Abandon Biden effort in Michigan, which worked with a broad coalition of like-minded organizations and advocates to urge Democrats to vote “uncommitted.” More than 100,000 Michigan voters cast an “uncommitted” ballot last week in a rebuke of Biden. Taslima hoped for similar results in Minnesota.

Democratic voters’ sentiments ran the gamut in the Twin Cities Tuesday. Some marked “uncommitted,” but planned to vote for Biden in the fall anyway, presuming that he would win his party’s nomination to run in the November 5 presidential election against the Republican frontrunner, former President Donald Trump. Others said they would never vote for Biden under any circumstance, and some reluctantly voted for Biden.

Many seemed to share one thing: a lack of enthusiasm for the Democratic incumbent.

“It’s Trump the Treasonous and Genocide Joe,” said Kevin Pollard, who reluctantly cast a vote for Biden in St. Paul’s Frogtown neighborhood over the lunch hour. “I’m not a huge fan, but we’ve got to live here, so, you know, you make the right decision.”

The day marked a milestone for Pollard, 18, who cast his first vote ever in an election. He came to the polls with his sister, Lena Pollard, 24, who also voted for Biden. She was reluctant as well, referring to Biden’s support and funding of the war against Hamas as “genocide.” But she fears a second Trump term.

“I think people have a better choice [in Biden],” Lena Pollard said, “because God knows if Trump gets elected, that’ll just be another disaster. I just think if we go that route again, people don’t understand how worse it will be. It’ll be worse than the storming into the Capitol.”

Biden and Trump are leading their primary races across the country.

Abdirizak Bihi, a well-known community advocate in Cedar-Riverside, spent Tuesday encouraging people in his community to get out and vote. Most people he talked to weren’t planning to vote, he said.

Many were unaware that they could vote uncommitted, he said, adding that once he informed them of that choice, they became more willing to head to the polls.

Bihi predicted that many Democrats in Minnesota would mark their ballots uncommitted Tuesday. Those voters want a ceasefire, and want the U.S. government to commit to donating food and medicine to the people of Gaza, he said.

Bihi added that regardless of the United State’s response to the war, he’s urging people to vote Democrat this fall, even if the candidate is Biden.

“On a daily basis, I work with refugee families,” Bihi said. “This administration is the only one that will help you bring your families here.”

Bihi would not reveal how he voted in the Tuesday primary, stating simply that he voted “Democrat.”

Hassan Abdel Salam, a Minnesota member of the Abandon Biden national coalition, said the group spent the last few weeks urging Minnesotans to vote uncommitted in the primary.

“We’ve been organizing to the fullest extent,” said Salam, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota. “We’ve been speaking at the mosques. Our phone banks have been on fire.”

Salam spent the afternoon with Abandon Biden supporters handing out fliers to passers-by in Cedar-Riverside. He said the Abandon Biden campaign doesn’t have a goal for the number of uncommitted votes cast in Minnesota, and will encourage voters in swing states to abstain from voting for Biden in upcoming primaries.

The campaign then plans a big push into the general election, and is looking into endorsing a third party candidate like Jill Stein or Cornel West, Salam said.

Salam said he’s well aware that the effort could lead to another Trump presidency. Salam said he is anti-Trump, disliking him so much during his presidency that he rarely uttered his name out loud.

“I find him distasteful,” Salam said of Trump. “He prevented our friends and family and colleagues from entering the country. But Mr. Biden killed them.”

A vote for Biden this fall would “reward” that behavior, Salam reasoned.

“Four years under any Republican is not comparable to one day in Gaza,” he said.

The message wasn’t enough to move every Muslim voter in the area. Ali Dulae, 59, marked uncommitted on his ballot, hoping it will send a message to Biden on his policies supporting Israel. But the longtime Democrat said he will vote for Biden this fall if he is the Democratic Party nominee.

“I will never go to the Republican side,” Ali said. “I am always a Democrat.”

Abdulahi Abdile voted for Biden in the primary despite his disapproval of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

“I don’t like what he’s doing outside of the country, but I voted for him because I prefer what he’s doing inside the country,” Abdulahi said.

While many Abandon Biden members have focused their messaging on the primary elections, some say they will not vote for Biden this November under any circumstance.

“I don’t think there is anything this administration can do to move me as a voter,” said Mohamed Ibrahim, an organizer with the Abandon Biden team. “We have gone beyond that point.”

The Abandon Biden effort grew out of a long-brewing sentiment that Muslim voters were ignored well before the Israel-Hamas war, Mohamed said. It dates back to former President George W. Bush’s War On Terror, former President Barack Obama’s Countering Violent Extremism FBI Task Force, and Trump’s travel bans against Muslim majority countries, among other issues, Mohamed said.

Biden’s support of funding Israel’s attacks on Gaza with U.S. tax dollars is the latest example of anti-Muslim bipartisan policies, he said.

“Muslims fall on both sides of the aisle, but we’ve always drawn the short end of the stick,” Mohamed said

It’s important, Mohamed said, that Muslims don’t always have to squint their eyes or plug their noses every time they cast a ballot in an election.

“We shouldn’t have to choose the lesser of two evils,” he said. “We as Americans should be able to vote for somebody who is conscious of being a global citizen.”

And if the effort leads to a second Trump term in the White House? Speaking for himself, Mohamed said it’s worth the risk.

“We’ve seen Trump; we’ve survived Trump,” Mohamed said. “I would rather myself struggle with four more years of Trump than having innocent women and children get carpet bombed like we have seen over the past five months. That is a reality that I’m willing to go through.”

Taslima, the 20-year-old who cast her first vote in a presidential race Tuesday, isn’t sure whether she’ll vote for Biden in November if he wins the Democratic nomination as expected.

“At this moment, I can’t see myself voting for him,” she said. “But if he changes his position, I could see myself doing so. Preferably, I would want another candidate.”"
