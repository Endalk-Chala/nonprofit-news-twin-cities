Ya’ll, it’s been a long year.
Ever heard of news fatigue? If not, congratulations. Simply being here today means you likely don’t have it as bad as many of your peers. 
And, look: I get it. There’s a lot going on. All. The. Time. It’s too much. It’s hard to stay on top of everything, moving from one headline to the next, while also being interrupted by animal videos, makeup demo reels and home improvement tips. Local news is also often overshadowed by global and national news, especially as President-elect Trump is inaugurated for a second time in a few weeks. 
 


 


The endless news cycle never stops. With that in mind, here’s a look back at some ongoing local stories from 2024 (that many of us have already forgotten about) to keep an eye on going into 2025: 
The Uber and Lyft debacle 
Controversy over rideshare driver pay first heated up in 2023, when Gov. Tim Walz vetoed a bill with wage and work rules for rideshare drivers. Minneapolis took things into its own hands in March 2024, passing a minimum wage ordinance. Then, the Legislature stepped in with its own statewide standard rates for rideshare companies, including the national duopoly Uber and Lyft. The final law passed in the mega 1,400-page omnibus bill on the last day of the legislative session included 
preemption
, which means cities now cannot set their own rideshare rates in Minnesota.

As of Dec. 1, the new rideshare minimum pay rates are $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute.
Many alternative rideshare companies to Uber and Lyft looked to launch in their place as the two companies threatened to leave the Twin Cities and state if minimum rates increased. The two major companies didn’t leave, but 
some alternative rideshare companies remained. 
 


 


Deciding what to do with the Minneapolis former third precinct 
This year marked the fourth year since the former Third Precinct was barricaded and fenced in with barbed wire amid the civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd. As of this fall, the barbed wire has come down. However, this year marked continued debate between Mayor Jacob Frey’s administration and the Minneapolis City Council over what to do with the former police station.

In 2023, the council decided 
police would not return to the site
. Now, the city wants to turn the building at
 3000 Minnehaha Ave.
 into a democracy center. The center would permanently house the city’s election and voter services department in its second floor office space. However, the City Council did not give its stamp of approval for this plan earlier this year. Instead, the majority of council members want to see further public outreach before a decision is made. 
As debate continued, the property became political fodder for politicians, including Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance, who used the barbed wire and barriers around the site as a backdrop for a pre-election news conference. 
Historic flooding
After a few years of drought conditions, this year Minnesota had one of its wettest years on record.  When the 
Rapidan dam
 in southern Minnesota partially failed in June due to historic flooding across the upper Midwest, 
the precarious state of dams across the country and state was thrust into the spotlight.

As extreme weather conditions due to climate change are anticipated to become more common, 
more stress will be put on infrastructure across the state like culverts under roads, bridges, dams and even roadways
, according to Paul Jackson, professor of chemistry and environmental studies at St. Olaf College. 
Hennepin County pressured to expedite closure of HERC incinerator 
The Minneapolis City Council 
wants the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC) incinerator closed by 2028,
 and Mayor Jacob Frey has gone as far as to say that he 
would like the county to close the HERC by 2027.

The council passed a resolution urging the county to close the incinerator on this timeline. In response, Hennepin County has asked Minneapolis to come up with a plan for how it will handle the city’s trash following the HERC’s closure. In its resolution, the city council pledges to increase city-led waste-reduction efforts and to explore landfills that could receive city trash if the county shuts the incinerator down. 
The fall of Smith Foundry 
Smith Foundry, a metal processing plant in Minneapolis’ East Phillips neighborhood, closed in August of this year 
after reaching a settlement with the EPA that barred the facility from operating as a foundry.
 The closure came after the foundry was cited for 
Environmental Protection Agency violations
 including violating the Clean Air Act for five years.
 


 


 


 


The public first learned of these violations after they were reported on by Sahan Journal last November. In a request for emails from August of last year when the violations were filed, through November after the story broke, Sahan uncovered that Smith Foundry was not equipped to respond to public concerns about its operation. 
Minneapolis Carbon Emissions Fees 
Minneapolis carbon emission fees will be applied next year, but this will start later than the Minneapolis City Council originally planned. The timeline for the implementation of these fees changed after a veto by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. In his veto, the mayor wrote that the intended timeline the council proposed simply could not be done legally.

The council ultimately overrode the mayor’s veto.
 But it was an amended version — modified in a way Frey’s office said would make it possible for the city to legally implement. Specifically, they extended the fee’s implementation date from Jan. 31 to July 1. The council also brought forward an ordinance to establish a funds system within the city’s health department.  
Minneapolis School’s technology tax 
In November, Minneapolis voters approved an increase to a Minneapolis Public Schools technology levy.
 Voters passed a $20 million increase that will bring the levy to a total of $38 million over the next 10 years. The initiative was approved 66% to 34%. This increase comes after a year of tough budgeting on the part of MPS. 
In a Q&A with MinnPost earlier this year,
 Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams said the levy would be a “big part” of the district’s coming budget strategy.
 


 


School officials have said 
the original levy does not cover all of the district’s technology expenditures and that the district has pulled from its general fund in the past to offset that.
 With an expanded tax, the district says it can use the general fund dollars otherwise used on technology for other purposes, including operations.
St. Paul voters move local elections to even years, deny early child care tax 
This year, St. Paul voters voted 
to move local elections to even years but voted against a referendum that would have given the mayor the ability to employ an early child care tax. 
The move to even-year elections will not be applied until 2028, but this will be a major change that some 
election officials fear will impact the city’s ability to have ranked-choice voting
. A law concerning optical scanning equipment, the most commonly used election tabulation tool, says only a single ballot card can be used at the polls. But this doesn’t completely eliminate the ability for ranked-choice voting to be included on even years; it just makes it more difficult to do so. 
A 2017 report by a Minneapolis city attorney also 
outlined this paradoxical nature of current law,
 concluding it would be particularly difficult to have ranked-choice voting on even years. This legal gray area could be remedied if St. Paul moved to the latest touch screen technology on the market for polling places. 
Even if voters had passed the early child care tax on the ballot, Mayor Melvin Carter had said he 
would not have implemented
 the levy increase. Carter said the ballot language was misleading because the amount of money raised by the levy wouldn’t be enough to cover everything outlined in it for all low-income families.

Update: Mayor Melvin Carter announced Thursday afternoon that he line-item vetoed multiple parts of the council’s budget right before end of day Wednesday, including pulling $1.8 of renovation funds for city council offices and putting that money into funding police overtime. He also implemented a new hiring and contracting freeze he says is necessary to balance the budget.
About a $19 difference in property taxes per median homeowner in St. Paul sparked frustration between the City Council and mayor last week as both proposed 2025 budgets for the city. 
The council adopted a budget that deviated in many ways from what was proposed in a compromise budget by the city’s mayor at its Dec. 11 meeting. Ultimately, the tax levy difference between the mayor’s compromise budget was about 1%, with the budget passed raising property taxes by 5.9% as opposed to the mayor’s proposed 6.9% increase – down from his original 7.9% proposal. 
 


 


For the owner of a median-value $275,000 St. Paul home, the 5.9% levy increase amounts to an additional $98 per year in city property taxes. Additional increases will come when the school district, Ramsey County and Metropolitan Council pass their budgets.
During last week’s meeting, council members supporting the $415 million approved budget noted many times that they believe every penny counts for city residents. Ward 5 council member Hwa Jeong Kim said the council had “taken a scalpel over an axe” in crafting the budget that was passed.

“At a time when folks are literally pinching pennies together to make ends meet, I think it’s important then that the city finds pennies in the couch and that we are looking responsibly at sources of money and using more restrictive dollars for our programs, instead of asking taxpayers to foot the bill first,” Kim said.

The state deadline for cities to adopt a final budget was Wednesday and, 
unlike Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey
, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter did not veto the council-passed budget. 
 


 


That doesn’t mean Carter is happy about it, however.
In a statement, the mayor said the council’s action “saves median homeowners $19 per year by cutting millions in police staffing and other city services without a plan, reducing funding for streets and sidewalks, and eliminating two total positions — director of Human Rights and police property room clerk — while adding two new titles to the City Council’s staff.”
The impact of the $19-per-property cut will not become fully clear until the new year. 
The largest cuts by the council targeted the city’s Police Department, including. a $1.2 million reduction to non-emergency police overtime. Instead, the council set aside $700,000 in contingency funds for police overtime, which can only be accessed if the department issues quarterly reports about how it’s spending those overtime dollars.

In a meeting held with members of the local news media before the council vote, Carter said his compromise proposal to the council was meant to “prevent major disruptions to city departments” including “first and foremost” police and fire, along with other departments that rely heavily on the city’s general fund such as parks and recreation and libraries. 
The mayor said police overtime is used primarily because the city is short 67 officers. He said overtime dollars also, in part, contribute to the city’s higher-than-average
 homicide clearance rate, which is 80%, according to the department.
Four St. Paul council members are new to their roles and finishing their first year in office. Carter noted this and said, as a former council member, he saw this year’s council approaching the budget process in a way unlike any council before. He expressed frustration with reductions in funds he described as “unspecified,” meaning the council has not made it clear what the intended impact of those cuts will be. 
Council President Mitra Jalali was the sole vote against the council-passed budget. Jalali noted that the council and administration had gone through a tough public negotiation process “because there’s so much distance between where our council wants to be and where the administration wants to be”
 


 


“I’ve worked really hard to hold that conflict,” she said. “There has to be a balance, for me, between funding important services and having capacity to respond to unknowns and bringing the property tax down. And, there are decisions made in this proposal that I have concerns about in the name of bringing the levy down, and I just worry that the tradeoffs aren’t worth it.”

In a news release following the passage of its budget, the council said the Police Department overspent its overtime budget by $3 million over the past three years and is projected to overspend its current budget by $5 million this year alone. This is why the contingency fund was created with a goal to “create more transparency around overtime spending.”
“The Council is committed to working with the Administration and the department to improve overtime spending reporting,” the release reads. “More precise data on activities that contribute to police overtime will help curb future overspending. At the same time, the city continues to support hiring strategies that increase the number of new officers and reduce overtime reliance.”

On its surface, several things made this week’s Minneapolis budget unique from any budget prior: 
The city faces the expiration of federal pandemic relief dollars from the American Rescue Plan (a challenge cities across the country face).


The City Council passed the mayor’s proposed budget with a record 71 amendments, including transferring funds away from the police department’s horse mounted patrol (and thanks to a council member who opposed this, we know the names of the horses being laid off: Haven, Maximillion, Buster, Blue, Trooper, Teak, Goliath, Rooster and Cabo).


Mayor Jacob Frey vetoed the council-passed budget, the first budget veto in his tenure.


The council overrode the mayor’s veto of the budget with a supermajority vote.
No matter what municipality you live in, this year’s budget process was primed to be tough with the looming Dec. 31 expiration of federal American Rescue Plan dollars. Parts of the budget priority shift also came from President-elect Donald Trump’s election, including discussion around support for the city’s immigrant, transgender and nonbinary communities. 
But in Minneapolis, additional factors fed the unique aspects of this year’s budget process: next year’s elections for all City Council members and the mayor, plus the first budget cycle under a progressive majority council that’s often at odds with Frey. Why are council members running again after two-year terms? 
Redistricting changed the normal council election timeline. 
 


 


The Tuesday meeting included its fair share of tense moments and tiffs, many of which were over how certain nonprofits and projects were directly added to the budget via council member amendments. Ward 4 council member LaTrisha Vetaw lamented that she didn’t see enough representation of north Minneapolis in the nonprofits directly funded in these amendments. Ward 13 council member Linea Plamisano said the budget amendments felt like “trading money behind the scenes.” 
Ward 8 council member Andrea Jenkins pointed to these expenditures as well, which included funding for projects by nonprofits like the Latino Center for Community Engagement, Mercado Central, One Southside and Mni Sota Fund.

“I am absolutely positive that each and every one of these organizations do enormously great work,” Jenkins said. “They serve a need, a deep need in our community, but there are hundreds of nonprofits in our community that do the same thing, and so we’re saying these three nonprofits are our favorites, and the other nonprofits don’t even get an opportunity to apply for these very limited funds.”
This talking point during budget deliberations led to moments of contention. 
 


 


Council member Robin Wonsley called herself out for breaching council decorum after saying: “This idea that we’re just behind the scenes doing coordinated campaigns that I’ve heard — it’s just — I want to use whatever alternative word you could say to BS.” Any council member could bring forward budget amendments if they found a program particularly important, Wonsley added. “Bring an amendment,” she said. “It’s that easy.”
In his veto, Frey called the council’s budget “reckless” and claimed the budget will “increase property taxes for years to come” and that the council was reallocating money from essential city services to “fund pet projects.” 
“Fiscally, times are tight — federal funding will likely be withheld, and state dollars are in short supply. We need to be responsible with our tax dollars,” Frey wrote. 
After overriding Frey’s veto, council member Jeremiah Ellison, who is not running for reelection next year, said he’s proud of the council-passed budget and the work that went into it.  
 


 


“Me and council member Palmisano, we come from a different culture of how things used to be, and I’ve spent the last year sort of grappling with the ways in which City Hall is changing,” Ellison said. 
While Ellison said he did see partisanship deepening between the council and city administration, he emphasized that he does not see this divide driven by council leadership, but rather by the Frey administration. 
 


 


“I think both sides of the government need to look in the mirror and figure out how we’re going to mitigate some of the fighting … how we make sure that staff are not caught in the crossfire,” Ellison said. 
Ellison, who has served as a council member since 2018, also said he’s heard many of the same talking points used by the administration in years past to discourage council budget amendments.  
 


 


“Ever since I’ve been in office, we’ve been told horror stories about what this is going
 
to be for the next budget and so on and so forth. They’ve never come to fruition,” Ellison said. 
The Minneapolis budget timeline
This year’s Minneapolis budget process has been a doozy. So here’s a timeline breaking down factors contributing to the process: 
November 2023:
 Minneapolis elects a progressive-leaning supermajority to the City Council. 
August 2024:
 Mayor Jacob Frey sets an 8.1% property tax levy increase cap for the 2025 budget (this he later increased to 8.3%).  
 


 


Sept. 11:
 Frey submits 
his recommended budget. 
Nov. 5: 
Donald Trump is elected president. 
Friday, Dec. 6: 
The City Council’s Budget Committee starts a three-day-long set of budget deliberations, which included crafting over 70 proposed budget amendments. 
Tuesday, Dec. 10: 
With a 10-2 vote, the City Council passes a $1.9 billion budget and 6.8% tax levy increase. The final budget 
included 71 total amendments to the mayor’s proposed budget.
Wednesday, Dec. 11: 
Frey vetoes the council’s budget. 
Thursday, Dec. 12: 
The council overrides the mayor’s veto with a 9-4 vote.  
Wednesday, Dec. 18:
 The state deadline for municipalities to have an approved budget. 
Dec. 31:
 American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds for cities across the nation expire.

Eden Prairie resident Jasper Hanke hoped to ride the Southwest light rail extension, now dubbed the Green Line extension, to get to classes at the University of Minnesota. 
But Hanke, a senior environmental sciences student who expects to graduate this summer, likely won’t have the chance, at least for school. “With the delay, I’m probably not gonna use it too much,” Hanke said as he waited for a ride home inside Southwest Station in Eden Prairie, the final stop of the light rail line and a hub for SouthWest Transit buses.
When the Metropolitan Council first broke ground on the Hennepin County-planned project in 2018, the agency planned to open the line in 2023. Amid problems with building a tunnel in the Kenilworth corridor, the project’s opening day was delayed to 2027, with a final cost of 
$2.86 billion
 to be settled at a 
Dec. 11 Met Council meeting
. 
 


 


The agency also 
faces scrutiny
 from the state Legislature regarding its finances and ability to rein in contractors, with a report expected to be finished this winter. And, the agency faces a federal lawsuit brought by 
one of their engineers
. A trial is anticipated to begin next September. 
Despite the challenges, much of the line from Belt Line Boulevard in St. Louis Park west to SouthWest Station is mostly complete. The overhead wires are up, the fencing is in, and the signals are waiting to be tested. Most of the trains purchased for the extension are running today on the Blue Line. And Metro Transit Route 17 buses began serving the Blake Road light rail station on Dec. 7, primarily so their drivers can use a new restroom while on breaks. All that appears to remain are the installation of Go-To card readers and ticket vending machines, 
which were ordered in August
.

After latest brutal Southwest LRT audit, some lawmakers question the point of the Met Council 
 






 


So why won’t Metro Transit, the agency that runs the region’s transit system under the Met Council, at least open the St. Louis Park to Eden Prairie segment to the riding public? It’s because there is no place along the line to maintain the trains.

“Light rail vehicles require access to the existing maintenance facilities in Minneapolis or St. Paul, as there is no maintenance facility being constructed as part of the Green Line Extension project,” spokesperson Drew Kerr said in an email. 
 


 


The agency initially 
reduced the size of the operations and maintenance facility
 to be built in Hopkins adjacent Shady Oak Road station as part of a 2015 cost-cutting move. In 2018, officials instead decided to expand the existing 
Blue Line maintenance facility
 in Minneapolis to handle the vehicles needed for the Green Line extension. The expansion was built in 2020. Part of the Hopkins site will now be home to a 
$14 million facility
 housing equipment to maintain the extension’s infrastructure. 
Metro Transit also can’t start testing on the line until it is completely built. “The entire alignment must complete – detailed testing, system integration and safety verifications – before revenue operations can commence,” Kerr added. 
If Metro Transit opened the completed Green Line extension segment in and west of St. Louis Park, Ben Bradford would ride it to work at a restaurant in St. Louis Park. “I feel like the train would be a lot faster than the bus,” Bradford said as he rode the 612, a bus route paralleling the Green Line extension on Excelsior Boulevard. 
 


 


Other transit agencies in the nation building light rail projects have been able to open parts of their lines in spite of construction affecting a crucial segment. In Washington state, for example, Sound Transit is building a $4 billion, 18-mile light rail line called the East Link to connect downtown Seattle with the region’s eastern suburbs, home to Microsoft. 
 


 


Sound Transit delayed the opening of the entire East Link line from mid-2023 to 2025 after it directed its construction contractor to rebuild 
faulty track-supporting concrete plinths
 on a viaduct leading to the floating bridge crossing Puget Sound.

However, after 
pressure from local elected officials and tech executives
, as well as studies by its staff, the Sound Transit board 
decided to open the completed segment
 in the eastern suburbs, dubbed the East Link Starter Line, earlier this year. What sets the East Link Starter Line apart from the completed Green Line extension segment is the East Link Starter Line is directly connected to an operations and maintenance facility along the line, which was built to support the extension. 
In Los Angeles, construction of a light-rail subway under downtown necessitated a two-plus-year split of the Metro L Line, which connected east Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley suburbs into two. One segment, running within East L.A., does not have a maintenance facility. The agency parked the trains running on that segment in a tunnel or at Atlantic station, the eastern end of the segment. Every month, trains needing maintenance were trucked to a facility on the segment serving the San Gabriel Valley. 
In the Twin Cities, Kerr said Metro Transit has more work to do to prepare for the line’s opening in 2027. Construction of the long-delayed Kenilworth tunnel is 95% complete, Kerr said, and workers have begun erecting overhead wires and installing communications systems. That work is expected to be finished in 2026. 
 


 


Crews are also wrapping up construction of the five Minneapolis stations, as well as the track between Target Field and Bryn Mawr station. They hope to begin installing signals, communications infrastructure and overhead wires on that segment starting at the end of the year.  
Vera Sachs is looking forward to the Green Line extension’s opening. She expects it to offer more frequent service between downtown Minneapolis and Eden Prairie than Southwest Transit’s express buses do today. “They’re just too infrequent and outdated,,” Sachs said, as she sat waiting, with another hour to go, for the next express bus to take her back to Minneapolis.

When the Minneapolis City Council passed its resolution to create a city Labor Standards Board, the motion passed in a 9-3 vote, a council supermajority. When Mayor Jacob Frey vetoed this resolution, proponents of the board as currently outlined in the council-passed resolution needed this supermajority to hold in an override vote.  
But at the council’s regular meeting this week, council members Jamal Osman and Andrea Jenkins changed course, sustaining the mayor’s veto. These council members joined Michael Rainville, LaTrisha Vetaw and Linea Palmisano in their opposition to the resolution. 
Shortly after the council vote that sustained the mayor’s veto, Osman released a statement about his changed vote. 
 


 


“While I initially voted for the Labor Standards Board, I expressed concern over the limited opportunities for residents of Ward 6 and the East African community to engage in the process and learn about what was proposed,” Osman wrote. 
The lack of a formal public comment period for the final Labor Standards Board resolution was a 
major point of contention
 leading up to the council’s initial vote on creating the board.

“By sustaining the veto, I’m not only amplifying community voices; I am both pro-worker and pro-small business,” Osman wrote. “In the pursuit of a fair and balanced Labor Standards Board, I am supporting a public comment for community members to come and let us know how you want to be reflected in this resolution. I invite my colleagues to open your minds and open your hearts.”
In her weekly newsletter to constituents, Jenkins said her thought at the time of the first vote was that she would support the resolution, “then work to improve it over time.”
 


 


“I did not know the mayor would veto the measure, however, once he did that presented an opportunity for us to work with constituents from the small-business community, many of whom are women and people of color,” Jenkins wrote. “What I’ve heard from folks is they do not feel they have had a voice in how the Labor Standards Board was drafted. There were repeated asks for public hearings to understand those concerns but those requests were denied.”
Work to establish the board will continue in January, she said.
 


 


The veto by Frey was not an outright “no” to a city Labor Standards Board. But the mayor also wants the makeup of the board to differ from the language passed by the council in its now-vetoed resolution. Rather than the council appointing 12 board members and the mayor appointing three, the mayor wanted to see 50/50 split between appointments. He has also said he would like to see a 50/50 split between employees and employers and require a supermajority consensus before bringing recommendations to council. He also has urged the council to hold a public hearing on the issue. 
In a statement made after his veto was sustained, which was read during the meeting by council member Linea Palmisano, the mayor said he looked forward to revisiting the issue in January.  
 


 


“The conversation does not end here. As I’ve said from the beginning, I support a balanced proposal, and I see a clear opportunity to get back to the table to bring both business and labor together and to get this done right,” Frey said in his statement. “We have a great opportunity for unity in this workgroup, and I suggest we take it.”
But council member Aurin Chowdhury said she is worried workers who saw council’s Thursday action will feel “demoralized” after years of conversation about labor standards, stating she could see them no longer wanting to participate in what the board could become. 
“I have looked at what the mayor has proposed, and I want to state that giving 50% of the seats to the business representative group and 50% of the seats to worker representatives and workers – then to say a two-thirds majority is required in order for a recommendation to move forward – is a veto essentially given to business representatives,” Chowdhury said. “Worker voices, I am afraid to say, will be stomped out and there will not be a recommendation to come before this body after robust conversations.”

There’s little momentum for turnstiles at Blue and Green Line light-rail stations,https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2024/12/theres-little-momentum-for-turnstiles-at-blue-and-green-line-light-rail-stations/,2024-12-06,,https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FareGateOptions940.png,"Daily Newsletter

Faced with growing community concerns about crime and fare evasion, last fall Metro Transit began a study on installing turnstiles at four of its light-rail stations.
This past July, they learned how much that would cost: $14 million, according to a report prepared by a consultant and obtained through a data practices request. 
The agency contracted with infrastructure design firm HNTB to evaluate installing turnstiles at four stations: Franklin Avenue, 46th Street, Snelling Avenue, and Warehouse District/Hennepin Avenue. The report does not evaluate installing turnstiles at Lake Street/Midtown Station, which the agency plans to rebuild 
as part of its efforts to renew and expand the Blue Line
. 
 


 


If Metro Transit does erect turnstiles at the four stations on its Blue and Green lines, both of which use light-rail vehicles that board at platforms 14 inches above the ground, it would be the first system of its kind in the United States to have them. The agency does not have any concrete plans to implement turnstiles at this time.
Metro Transit leaders and HNTB are worried that, because of the low floor height, people could simply walk on the tracks and step onto the platform, bypassing the turnstiles. This is less of a concern in cities such as Los Angeles, which have light-rail vehicles that board at platforms 39 inches above ground.  
“If you put in gates, you can just walk around, walk on the tracks. It would be worse, even more dangerous,” Met Council Chair Charlie Zelle said during an August bike tour of the Southwest Light Rail project.
Installing turnstiles also would require the agency to move its ticket vending machines so that they are off of the boarding area, where they are today. To accommodate the vending machines, the agency also would have to relocate poles that support the overhead wires, rebuild the ramps leading onto the platforms, and lengthen the raised platforms to close to 300 feet. This could be a challenge, particularly at the Warehouse District/Hennepin Avenue station, which at 260 feet is the shortest platform in the system.

The agency does not have current fare evasion rate figures for its light-rail system. In the past, Metro Transit has relied on spot checks to estimate the fare evasion rate. Based on those checks, the 
rate was estimated at between 8% and 10% in 2016
. 
In a presentation for Metro Transit prepared by the HNTB Corporation, modifications at the Warehouse District/Hennepin Avenue Station are envisioned to include a complete rebuild of both access ramps to provide additional space for the fare barrier plazas.

The agency also did not say how much money is lost due to fare evasion. However, the per-passenger subsidies for both light-rail routes have increased since the pandemic began, as ridership cratered before slowly recovering. Though 2023 ridership was 58% of 2019 levels, the system subsidy per passenger was close to three times higher, at 
$5.49
 versus 
$1.96
 in 2019. 
The report also suggests that the agency may need to consolidate its existing fare media products, which include paper transfers, magnetic transfers, as well as its mobile phone app, to be compatible with the Go-To card. Authors of the report believe no turnstiles available on the market today can handle barcodes, paper transfers, or magnetic transfers, though photos of 
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority’s new
 turnstiles deployed this year appear to show readers that accept barcodes and magnetic transfers. 
Nonetheless, retrofitting the existing ticket vending machines to “add” fare media capability — the report does not say which of their three different types of ticket vending machines they would need to retrofit, and the light-rail ticket vending machines can already reload Go-To cards — would cost $75,000 per machine. 
 


 


The agency pledges to study their fare collection systems in the next five years. Until then, the Met Council is 
studying and implementing changes to its transfer policy, fares, and passes
, as well as undertaking a $37.7 million upgrade to the 
Go-To card system
 to accept 
credit and debit cards
 in the next two years. This includes upgrading existing ticket vending machines at light-rail stations. 
“Any future effort that may be undertaken to add barriers to light-rail stations would require us to consider how the fare products available to riders would interact with that equipment,” Metro Transit spokesperson Drew Kerr said. 
 


 


Minneapolis resident Renee Pitman believes turnstiles would be a massive waste of money used to enable harassment of riders who can’t pay. “I’m worried that it would be a waste of money, that they would end up spending more money than they would make in fares,” Pitman said, adding that the train should be free. “I’m just opposed to any barriers to using transit because that’s an important part of getting people out of private vehicles and fighting climate change. The more people we can get not driving, the more chance we have in slowing down climate collapse.”
Even if the agency were to install turnstiles, Chair Zelle, speaking at the August bike tour, said the agency will need to increase its human presence. “Law enforcement, security, guides, community service officers, we just need people, including customers, to kind of maintain a standard of behavior and reduce crime,” Zelle said. 
 


 


As the agency continues to face challenges in hiring police — they remain short over 60 police officers, 
a number reported as early as 2022
 — it’s continuing to contract with private security and social service organizations to maintain order on the system, hire transit ambassadors to inspect fares, and work with unhoused youth 
to clean up St. Paul light-rail stations
.
The agency hasn’t encountered trouble in hiring Transit Rider Investment Program (TRIP) agents. “Our current internal-only opening, we had 30 applicants in three days,” TRIP manager Leah Palmer said at a November Met Council meeting. The agency now has 50 ambassadors, who have conducted close to 60,000 fare inspections in September alone. Pending the outcome of the 
Met Council’s unified budget
, which is now in the public comment stage, the agency hopes to double the number of ambassadors next year, while also expanding private security presence and social service partnerships. 
Officials believe the presence of ambassadors, private security and social service organizations have been effective. Metro Transit interim police chief Joe Dotseth reported at a 
November Met Council meeting
 that crime, not including smoking, decreased 2.4% in the third quarter of this year, compared to the same time period in 2023. Overall, crime in the third quarter of this year is 30% less than what it was in the first quarter of 2023. 
“When you see those crime numbers going down, it’s not just because of the work that the police are doing. It’s the work that TRIP agents are doing, supplemental security agents are doing, the work that we’re all doing as a team is the reason that that stuff is going down because we’re taking that community approach,” Dotseth said during the presentation. 
 


 


Still, the agency continues to have setbacks: Two trans women were harassed near the 
Warehouse District/Hennepin Avenue
 station last month, and on Nov. 29 Sharif Darryl Walker-El Jr. 
was shot and killed by a fellow passenger
 as a Green Line train neared the Hamline Avenue station. Police have not announced any arrests in either incident.
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct interim police chief Joe Dotseth’s name and to clarify that ticket vending machines are being upgraded, not replaced.

Minneapolis College and Metropolitan State University hope the recent renovations for  a combined business school space for students from both schools will improve the campus experience.
The schools held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Nov. 22 to mark the renovations to the 
Management Education Center
 in downtown Minneapolis. The renovations were funded with $22.5 million from the Minnesota Legislature’s 2023 bonding bill. While Minneapolis College and Metro State previously shared a business building, the addition of classrooms in the Management Education Center will allow students to more easily connect with faculty and staff from both schools. 
“One of our professors used to have his students have a scavenger hunt to find his office in the Management Education Center,” said Jason Cussler, a business instructor at Minneapolis College and community faculty at Metro State. 
 


 


“The students never had a reason to come over there. They never had any classes. (Now) our offices are going to be right next to the classrooms that students are taking their classes in. When you have a student (who) might have been hesitant to come visit you in the first place, you’re going to be saying, ‘Hey, well I’m just walking into my office here after class. Why don’t you come and we’ll sit down and chat about this?’”

Cussler added that the building will be beneficial for students in the Business Transfer pathway at Minneapolis College. Those students are able to enter four-year universities, including Metro State, as juniors after completing their second year at Minneapolis College (formerly known as Minneapolis Community & Technical College).. 
“(Being) in the same building and working together with a shared space (with) some shared branding around some things – that’s just gonna make it that much more easy for the student to make the transition to considering a four-year (degree),” Cussler said. 
Carisha Thomas, who attended Minneapolis College and is now pursuing a bachelor’s degree in business administration at Metro State, is also excited about the centralization the renovated center provides. Thomas, who also has a degree in marine wildlife and conservation biology, hopes to utilize her business education to develop an eco resort in her home country of Grenada.

“Knowing that you don’t have to go from one place to the next just to get one thing done, it makes it more convenient,” Thomas said. 
The building itself is also outfitted for collaboration and accessible learning, with various “huddle rooms” for students to reserve for different times to collaborate on projects. Screens and high-flex technology in classrooms, huddle rooms and lounge areas allow for students who are off-campus to continue to engage and participate virtually. 
 


 


Virtual access is especially valuable for students who may be balancing coursework with other responsibilities, including Thomas, who is a single mother. During this semester, Thomas’s son has been sick a couple of times, which has meant that she had to speak with instructors, including Cussler, about needing time to “figure (things) out.”

“(With high-flex technology), if your kid’s sick and you just need to sit there with them, you can sit and participate in the class while your kid’s resting,” Cussler said of the new setup, which he describes as having a camera follow the instructor around the classroom. 
 


 


Other possible student needs were considered in designing the space, said Marcia Hagen Ph.D., a professor at Metro State who was part of a committee that helped to design the renovation. 
“Metropolitan State is a MSI (a minority-serving institution),” Hagen said. “That actually drove some of the thought behind the building itself. We serve adult students, so we were able to do some different things. For example, we put in a meditation room where there wasn’t one previously. We’ve put in a room for nursing mothers who might have to leave class. In a way that wasn’t previously possible, we’re able to fulfill some of these (student) needs that we simply couldn’t in the past.”

The renovation also features a new entrepreneurship center on the fourth floor, a collaborative, open space that is designed to facilitate a variety of connections inside and outside both schools.
“We hope to partner with local entrepreneurs within the community that will mentor students (who are) interested in entrepreneurship (and) that will hire students interested in small businesses,” Cussler said, adding that the faculty also hope that students from different departments are able to engage with business students to seek out advice. 
 


 


In renovating the Management Education Center, Hagen said, faculty “really wanted to create a top-notch place for students to come and spend time and grow academically and collaborate with each other and the community.
“For us to be able to do that and in addition, (to) have a more seamless transition for our Minneapolis College to Metro State students is just (the) icing on the cake.”

‘Bus bunching’ prevention: Metro Transit hopes D Line schedule changes will make it more reliable and less crowded,https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2024/11/bus-bunching-prevention-metro-transit-hopes-d-line-schedule-changes-will-make-it-more-reliable-and-less-crowded/,2024-11-25,,https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/940x625-2-3.png,"Daily Newsletter

This winter, Metro Transit is promising to make D Line buses more predictable and less crowded. 
From Dec. 9 until March 21, Metro Transit will try what is called “headway-based scheduling” on the state’s busiest route serving Brooklyn Center, north and south Minneapolis, Richfield, Bloomington, and the Mall of America. 
“The goal of headway-based scheduling is to have buses arriving at bus stops at evenly spaced intervals, improving service reliability, reducing wait times and overcrowding, and ensuring operators have consistent time to use the restroom, eat, stretch, etc., between trips,” wrote Metro Transit spokesperson Drew Kerr in a statement.   
 


 


Headway-based scheduling, which will happen only on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., involves drivers relying on the buses’ onboard computers to determine when to leave a terminal and to ensure they are spaced between 10 and 15 minutes apart from one another. “Those indications will help operators adjust as needed, such as holding at a stop if they are too close, for example,” wrote Kerr. That’s in contrast to a driver trying to stay on a stringent schedule for each stop. Buses will also be able to manipulate traffic signals to keep moving.

The agency plans to have extra buses available on standby to make trips, just in case of delays. The agency currently uses at most 21 buses on the route, according to schedules obtained from the 
Pantograph app
, an app that tracks the real-time location of buses. 
The D Line isn’t Metro Transit’s most reliable route. D Line buses going in the same direction sometimes operate closely with one another, with one running on time, and another running several minutes late, in a phenomenon known as bus bunching. The late bus could be slowed down by icy or snowy roads, a driver or a malfunctioning machine trying to secure a passenger in a wheelchair, a large crowd boarding a very late bus, or transit personnel trying to remove an unruly passenger. Agency staff say its length — 18 miles — as well as its ridership of just under 14,000 average weekday riders as of September, are contributing factors.
Metro Transit says the bus has had a 75% on-time performance rating so far this year, with on-time performance meaning the bus arrives within one minute early or five minutes late to a stop. In the past month, the Transit app — which provides estimated arrival times and trip planning information — reported that among 129 users, D Line buses arrived on time 63% of the time. 
 


 


 


 


Elliot Park resident Wanda Edwards is looking forward to the change as the weather turns. “I think that’s wonderful, especially knowing the weather is going to change. It’ll be convenient. I can walk out my door and catch the bus,” Edwards said on the D Line on her way to a store. 
Headway-based scheduling isn’t new to the agency. Metro Transit has used this on the A Line on Snelling Avenue over the past two Minnesota State Fairs to ensure buses arrive at stops every 10 minutes despite traffic congestion. 
Headway-based scheduling is also used on high-frequency bus routes on the West Coast, with mixed results. The Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, serving cities immediately to the east of San Francisco, found implementing headway-based scheduling on one of their busiest trunk lines in the early 2000s 
reduced travel times by 17%
, an effect noticed by riders. On the other hand, Los Angeles Metro plans to 
discontinue headway-based scheduling
 on one of its local bus routes connecting West Hollywood with downtown Los Angeles next month because the project did not improve reliability. 
Metro Transit says it still plans to use a printed schedule to support trip planning and real-time information tools, as well as to divide up work to their drivers. They are also directing riders who need to make transfers to less frequent routes to use their trip planner, which provides a five-minute time buffer for transfers.
 


 


Dwayne Smith, who recently started working at the Mall of America and takes the D Line there, was confused upon hearing about Metro Transit’s headway-based frequency plans. “You wanna know, when you walk out, is this bus gonna be there a particular time,” said Smith while riding the bus to work. 
Despite the changes, Smith adds the D Line overall is an improvement over the route it mostly replaced almost two years ago, the Route 5. “It’s a fast route and it’s accurate. It’s on time, never really late,” Smith said.

Near the Franklin Street light rail station, a line of people waited by the back doors of the Aliveness Project’s red van, reciting their initials and year of birth to a staff member holding an iPad. Inside, Logan Huber, wearing a snowflake-patterned blue beanie, organized red paper bags filled with wound care kits, needles, smoking equipment, Narcan and fentanyl and xylazine test strips. 
When Huber had finished filling each bag with requested items, he handed them to other members of the Aliveness Project team or to a volunteer, who passed them on to the recipients, some of whom arrived via the light rail. Staff also handed out water and snacks.
This van, named “Thrivey” by the Aliveness Project, is part of the organization’s efforts to prevent the spread of HIV. As HIV can be spread through contaminated needles, Thrivey provides people with clean needles, along with smoking equipment, a safer alternative to injection. 
 


 


There are multiple outbreaks of HIV being tracked by the Minnesota Department of Health – two in Hennepin and Ramsey county, and one in the Duluth area. One of the two outbreaks in Hennepin and Ramsey is linked to injection drug users who “live or have spent time in a known encampment corridor in Minneapolis or St. Paul.” As of Sept. 3, this outbreak has been associated with 122 reported cases. 
To see for myself how staff at the Aliveness Project use Thrivey to reach out to people, I rode along with a team on Friday, Nov 15.

Outside the van, a fabric wagon held different hygiene products available for people to take, from individually wrapped tampons to travel-size deodorant. The rule for these handouts, staff member Amber Muhm later told me, is that everything in there is something staff would use and buy themselves, not just the cheapest items available. 
Near the wagon were two bins. One held containers meant to dispose of sharps, while the other was to collect needles themselves, gathered by those coming to the van. For every quart of needles received, the Aliveness Project gives out a $5 Cub Foods gift card. 
 


 


Ideally, these needles would be held in a sharps container – like the ones in the bin next to the needle collection bin – before they are exchanged. On Friday, though, most people who showed up with needles had them in a variety of shopping bags. By the end of the shift, the collection bin was nearly full – stacked with bags and other containers of needles.

While I was only with the team for one shift, they have a weekly schedule. On Monday, Thrivey makes a midday stop at the Dorothy Day Opportunity Center in St. Paul. On Wednesday, it’s an early afternoon stop at 2500 E. Lake Street, near Target, and on Friday afternoon Thrivey visits this spot near the Franklin Street light rail station. On Tuesday afternoon, the van takes time, Muhm said, “to float and go wherever the encampments are, wherever the people are.”

During this Friday stop, staff placed a full menu of Thrivey’s offerings near the van’s open back doors: gauge sizes of available needles and various pipe options for smoking. The menu also included this incentive: If you decide to go to medication-assisted treatment, the Aliveness Project will provide transportation to your first appointment, along with a $25 gift card. 
In addition to what I saw distributed on Friday, the van also has a compartment for quick HIV testing, using INSTI testing kits. While testing wasn’t available when I was out with the team, Muhm told me that HIV testing would be available later that night at The Black Hart, a queer soccer bar in St. Paul.
 


 


Harm reduction and critics
Some critics, including members of the Legislature, said Muhm, see the van as enabling drug use, which she says is an inaccurate depiction of the team’s work.
“People say ‘They’re giving away drug paraphernalia out in public,’ and our response is kind of like, ‘Yep. And we’re also getting people into treatment. We’re also giving people Narcan. We’re also giving people wound care kits and food and a consistent schedule.’” said Muhm, a trans community specialist in the Aliveness Project’s HIV outreach and prevention program. She added that she has heard elected officials, including city council members, say that harm reduction doesn’t work, a sentiment she disagrees with and calls “frustrating.” 
As HIV can be spread through contaminated needles, Thrivey provides people with clean needles, along with smoking equipment, a safer alternative to injection.

“I’ve personally seen several instances of someone coming to the van consistently over the course of eight (or) nine weeks and then finally saying, ‘Hey, I would like to go to treatment. Can you help set that up?’ This work saves lives.” 
 


 


While Muhm believes in the work she and her colleagues do, she also noted that sweeps of encampments have made it difficult for service providers to find and offer harm reduction to people who are unhoused and using drugs. 
 


 


“(The sweeps are) incredibly frustrating to watch both as a resident of Minneapolis and as a service provider,” Muhm said. “They happen very suddenly and even when we’re tipped off ahead of time or we respond to it, a lot of times we get there and we are not allowed to help at all. We(‘ve) witnessed firsthand how devastating it is for people.”  
This destabilization has impacts on both the mental and physical health of people Muhm has seen coming to the van. When encampments are cleared, people’s belongings are dumped and they “are told to go somewhere else and then there is no somewhere else,” she said.
“They’re just in hyper-vigilance survival mode all the time. That sucks away all your energy. It leaves people in fear like, ‘When is it gonna happen next?’” said Muhm. 
In terms of physical health, she added, “A lot of these camps are set up to provide community care. They’re set up in a way where people can take care of each other and where outside service providers like us can go provide supplies and get people on track to get housing, (treatment or services). If people are getting kicked out all the time and moved around, it’s really hard to build any kind of consistency and it just grinds people down over time.”

Lived experience 
Huber, who was working inside the van on Friday, and Brandon Carmany, a Aliveness Project volunteer who helped hand out supplies that day, both have lived experience with the community they are assisting. 
“Honestly, it feels good to give back,” said Carmany, who began volunteering two months ago with the van on Wednesdays and Fridays. “It’s nice to see people I used to interact with that are still alive. The high I get from helping others, no other drug could compare to.” 
Huber, who works under the Native American Care Linkage grant at Aliveness Project, noted that many of those who come to the van for assistance are people of color or from other marginalized communities. 
“As a person of color, myself, I just wanna be out here and kinda hold that space for people,” said Huber, who is from the Lower Sioux Indian community. Even while he was still using drugs himself, Huber said, he was advocating for his community, noting that due to systematic racism, harm reduction and even information about harm reduction can be inaccessible to Native Americans. 
“As a result, a lot of my friends that are my age (have had) open heart surgeries (or) are dead from overdoses,” he said. 
As Thrivey and its staff’s work continued, some of those approaching the van greeted or even hugged staff members, recognizing them from previous visits. One person asked about Aliveness-provided transportation to treatment. In response, Huber gave them a number to contact him with to set up transportation, whenever they were ready, wherever they were. 
Where to find Thrivey
On Mondays, Thrivey is at Dorothy Day Opportunity Center from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM


On Tuesdays, Thrivey travels around to find encampments from 12:30 to 2:30 PM 


On Wednesdays, Thrivey is at 2500 E Lake Street, near a Target from 1:00 to 3:00 PM 


On Fridays, Thrivey is by the Franklin Street Light Rail Station from 1:00 to 3:00 PM

Update: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey vetoed the Minneapolis Labor Standards Board resolution Thursday, Nov. 21, offering an alternative structure for the board. Notably, the resolution passed 9-3, which represents a supermajority. If the council vote remains the same on an override, the board will still pass.
There’s been plenty of heated debate over the 
creation of a Labor Standards Board
 in Minneapolis. But labor standards work is already being done in many cities across the state and country. 
For example, a week before the Minneapolis City Council approved a labor board,  the St Paul City Council passed a wage theft ordinance that was recommended and brought forward by the city’s Labor Standards Advisory Committee. 
 


 


To be clear, the 
St. Paul Labor Standards Advisory Committee
 and the to-be created Minneapolis Labor Standards Board are different. In St Paul, the committee is designed to be made up of 16 members: six employers, six employees and four at-large community representatives. Members are appointed by the mayor, who brings his selections to the council for approval. 
The Minneapolis Labor Standards Board will be made up of 15 members – 12 appointed by the council and three appointed by the mayor. The board will have an even split between employers, employees and “community stakeholders,” with each group having five seats. The Minneapolis board also will have “sectoral workgroups” – groups that are focused on employment within a particular business sector.
Both groups, however, are tasked with engaging employers, employees and community members and advising on labor standards issues in their respective cities.
The Minneapolis Labor Standards Board will make recommendations to the mayor and the City Council as they study wages, benefits, training and working conditions. The St. Paul Labor Standards Advisory Committee advises and supports the city’s 
Labor Standards Enforcement and Education Division
, which oversees the city’s Minimum Wage and Earned Sick and Safe Time ordinances and is a source for workers and businesses in Saint Paul to provide education on requirements and investigate complaints. It also can bring forward recommendations to the City Council, as it did before the wage theft ordinance was adopted.

St. Paul and state law 
The new wage theft ordinance in St. Paul essentially codified state law around the issue, said Beth Commers, interim director for the city’s Human Rights and Equal Economic Opportunity division (HREEO).
Working with the St. Paul Labor Standards Advisory Commission is important because its representatives “understand the landscape in different ways than staff do,” Commers said. 
Notably, 
Minneapolis passed its own wage theft ordinance in 2019
, giving attorneys within the city’s 
Department of Civil Rights
 authority to enforce the municipal law against wage theft. This was also prompted by the 2019 change in state law. 
Any time an employer fails to pay wages, employees are legally entitled to, 
that is wage theft
. This includes paying an employee less than minimum wage, not paying overtime, requiring work without pay, denying legal breaks, misclassification, withholding tips, non-payment of fringe benefits and illegal deductions. 
 


 


“Wage theft has been illegal in Minnesota for a while,” Commers said. “But the city staff, the city investigators, we don’t have enforcement capability for state laws, right? We would get calls, but we would have to refer to the (state) Department of Labor and Industry.” That changed with passage of the city ordinance. 
The St. Paul ordinance does not make any new requirements for employers or employees. Rather, it gives the HREEO investigators the enforcement capacity to investigate allegations of wage theft. It also provides Saint Paul businesses with local tools to address any instances of suspected wage theft. 
Before taking the wage theft ordinance to the City Council, the St. Paul Labor Standards Committee spent more than a year speaking with community stakeholders, employees and employers about the issue, said Alanna Galloway, Labor Standards Advisory Committee co-chair. A major goal in putting it on the table was to raise awareness about the problem, she added. 
It “shocked” Galloway to learn that wage theft is one of the largest forms of theft across the state and country. The Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry estimates more than 39,000 workers suffer from wage theft statewide each year. This has an impact of 
$11.9 million of wages owed,
 but not paid, to Minnesota workers.
 


 


 


 


“We generally think of theft as somebody with a knife on the street,” Galloway said. “But people who are going to work and not receiving their pay, that’s damaging, often more monetarily damaging to more residents and workers. So it’s a big deal and we need to make sure that we’re supporting and protecting the wages of workers.” 
Filling up the advisory council 
One interesting aspect of the St. Paul Labor Standards Advisory Council is that the body has struggled to have equal representation from both employers and employees. It’s employee-heavy right now, Commers said. She is working to gain more business representation through the St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce. 
The Labor Standards Advisory Committee was started in 2020, when many people were working remotely through the pandemic, Commers noted. Now that the committee’s meetings are in-person again, Commers believes it’s harder to attract time-stressed employers to serve. St. Paul also has a decades-old 
Business Review Council
, which has 75% representation from businesses. This council also makes recommendations to the city. 
“It’s hard when we have the Business Review Council that is full of employers, and then we have the LSAC, which is supposed to be split,” Commers said. “Some business owners in St Paul are like, ‘Well, we’re already on the Business Review Council.’ But the Business Review Council acts as a sounding board and a guidance giver for the mayor and council, but in a different way than the LSAC does. The LSAC has really been charged with recommending the future of this body of work in the city. They are the boots on the ground, too.” 
 


 


More from the Chamber of Commerce 
In the case of the wage theft, St. Paul Chamber President B Kyle said it’s important to note that the ordinance is not “additional overreach” by the city. Instead, it “empowers the city to implement what’s already been established at a state level.”
Kyle said the chamber has been contacted by the St. Paul Labor Standards Advisory Committee as the committee looks for more business representation. She also sees why it’s been tough for the committee to gain business membership. 
“People are busy. It’s just that simple, right? Which is why we have a Chamber of Commerce to advocate on their behalf,” Kyle said. “So we’ve been invited to participate in the labor standards committee in Saint Paul, which we appreciate, and we find that that relationship is very workable. In my experience, the city really does want to hear what we think and how we might provide input.” 
The chamber already has representation on the city’s Business Review Council. The difference between the advisory council and the review council comes down to specificity, Kyle said. The review council specifically works on how businesses can engage with government, while the advisory committee is more specific. 
John Perlich, the St. Paul chamber’s vice president of government affairs, is one of the newest appointees. 
“We debate, we wrestle with policy, we get reports from department heads, we have the opportunity to weigh in on issues that we support, on issues that we have concerns with,” Perlich said. “And really, it’s another avenue for the business community to have their voice heard by the mayor and the City Council and city departments as it relates to how they interact with the larger St Paul business community.”

Many colleges and universities are exploring ways to include artificial intelligence (AI) in teaching, learning and research in order to provide students with opportunities to learn more about the technology. 
Schools including the University of Minnesota and the University of St. Thomas have created programs and curriculum aimed at building student literacy in AI and ensuring students are ready to pursue opportunities after graduation. 
Many institutions are concerned about falling behind and therefore are working on AI-related strategies, according to an 
EDUCAUSE AI Landscape study
 done in February. 
 


 


The study also said the highest-ranking goals of AI-related strategic planning included preparing students for the future workforce, exploring new methods of teaching and learning, and improving higher education for the greater good. 
AI in the classroom
There are over 30 different degrees in one form or another around AI or data science at the U of M, according to Dr. Galin Jones, a statistics professor and chair of the Data Science Initiative.
“There’s lots of degree programs, there’s lots of research,” Jones said. “It happens in every college — it’s happening across CLA, it’s happening in journalism and it’s happening in statistics.”
Jones said AI curriculum is driven by faculty interest. For his teaching, Jones said he recognizes AI as a tool and something he uses himself for writing simple bits of code or making emails more engaging. 
 


 


“On the other hand, it can absolutely give you the wrong information,” Jones said. “And so I think what’s more important from my point of view is to teach students, and faculty for that matter, staff, everybody really, how to evaluate it critically and approach it critically.” 
Jayson Nguyen, a fourth-year engineering student at the U of M, said AI being used in classes is inevitable, but as an institution, students and faculty aren’t prepared for the advancements AI has made recently. 
“Most professors abhor the use of AI, and rightly so, as much of their curriculum is based on problems or writing assignments that are easily ChatGPT-able,” Nguyen said. “Students will often go for the easy ‘A’ rather than focusing on genuine learning.” 
While Nguyen said AI is beneficial in terms of saving time, he feels it comes at a cost. 
 


 


“The biggest downside is that it can make it easy to skip over the deeper learning process if you’re not careful,” Nguyen said. “It’s tempting to let AI do the heavy lifting, but that can lead to a superficial understanding of the material.” 
The U of M has policies about how to include AI in a syllabus and provides a menu of options for instructors. Jones said this is part of the academic freedom of getting to choose how to run a course. 
“For me, what I’m most concerned about is if you use it, then you’ve got to cite it, then you’ve got to say you used it and then you’re responsible for it,” Jones said.

After latest brutal Southwest LRT audit, some lawmakers question the point of the Met Council 
 






 


Dr. Manjeet Rege, a professor and chair of the Department of Software Engineering and Data Science at the University of St. Thomas, said the school encourages instructors to have an AI usage policy.
 


 


St. Thomas currently offers a master’s degree in AI along with graduate certificates, but no undergraduate degrees. According to Rege, the AI master’s degree program was started in spring of 2024. It’s a 10-course sequence that has classes including machine learning and AI ethics. 
Rege said in his class, he tells students to feel free to use any generative AI tool to derive an analogy or understand content better as long as it is not used on an exam. He added that he likes to give analogies in class so students can relate to the use of AI in the world and be able to understand how to use the technology. 
“How can this be used in a healthcare setting? How can this be used in tutoring?” Rege said. “So they can now take this particular scenario and ask ChatGPT, ‘Can you explain how this can be used?’”
If they don’t expose students to machine-learning technologies such as AI or ChatGPT, Rege said, educators are not preparing students for what they’ll be using in the real world.

More than just teaching
The U of M has a website called “
Navigating AI @ UMN
” that provides an understanding of what AI is and how it is used at the university. It includes approved AI tools, guidelines on how not to use it, and different AI communities and groups to get involved with. 
In the summer of 2023, the U of M started the 
Data Science Initiative (DSI)
, a university-wide effort tasked with collaboration and amplification of all the data science and AI activity happening around campuses, said Hayley Borck, the managing director of DSI.
Borck said the DSI also worked to create an AI Makerspace where students and staff can have a place to work with AI on the super computer provided by the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. 
“MSI has this big ol supercomputer in the basement of Walter Library, and it’s got many GPUs, and we just let people come in and have fun with it,” Borck said. “If they have specific questions, we can sort of work them through.” 
Borck said if a faculty member chooses to use AI in a course, they take on the responsibility of teaching how to use it correctly and responsibly, otherwise a student might use it to do their work for them. 
“You’re going to get sort of these issues of people who, you know, don’t really fully understand the tool and so more readily use it, in my mind at least, for things like plagiarism or just not doing their work instead of using it as an appropriate tool,” Borck said. 
Over half of students say they have 
used AI on assignments or exams
, according to a study done by BestColleges.
Rege said in his department at St. Thomas, they use AI as part of its testing protocols. He added in order to keep testing options flexible for students who might be remote or out of state, AI allows everyone to be monitored equally. 
For example, Rege said if a test is open-notes, students can use Google or certain software on their computer during the test, but they aren’t allowed to go to ChatGPT or it will send the instructor an alert. 
 


 


“The other is you have closed notes,” Rege said. “So you can only access the exam online, on the learning management system Canvas, but you cannot do anything else. You cannot open even a tab of a browser.” 
Rege said with the closed notes online exams, usually the computer camera will monitor the student for the duration of the exam using AI and will alert the instructor if another person comes onto the screen. 
“Most of (the students), I would say 99% of them, have no issues with this at all,” Rege said. “We are up front with the policy, with the communication, and ultimately, it’s about maintaining academic integrity. Most students are honest, but we don’t want some students who may be tempted to cheat, to kind of, you know, malign or affect our reputation as well.”
The future of AI in universities
AI can be used for more than just teaching or research. Jones said he sees a lot of international students with English as their second language use AI to make their prose better, even on assignments. 
“That makes me nervous as an instructor because is it really their work then? What exactly are they submitting?” Jones said. 
Nguyen said there are major concerns about AI being used in universities and classrooms because of the potential for students to become over-reliant. 
“Another concern is fairness, as not all students have equal access to AI tools as most now have a paywall for better versions which could widen the gap between those with more resources and those without,” Nguyen said. 
However, Jones said some of his students say they never use AI or ChatGPT because they don’t trust it, saying, “They’re even more conservative than an old fart like me.” 
Borck said many students and educators are excited about using AI, and said she sees it as a way for them to be able to do traditionally more complex jobs that they weren’t able to do previously because they can now use AI as a clutch and tool. 
An example Borck gives is to imagine if a cow gets bloated and needs to have its stomach popped to release gas before it becomes fatal. 
“So say you’re a rural farmer and your vet is an hour and a half away and is busy with some other cow who has this issue,” Borck said. “I asked ChatGPT to walk me through the procedure to do that, and it gave me the steps.” 
When Borck asked ChatGPT for further clarification on specific steps, it would tell her exactly how to do something, like how to stitch up a cow and what tool could be used for that. 
“Things like that are going to become — like that’s a little bit dangerous — but it also could save a cow’s life,” Borck said. “So things like that are going to become a lot easier.” 
Another way users are seeing AI make things easier is in daily operations, especially when it comes to the universities. The U of M Positioned for Excellence, Alignment and Knowledge (PEAK) Initiative is a systemwide strategic initiative that 
transforms how the university administers critical services
. 
“It’s a reorganization of the university’s internal functions,” Jones said about PEAK. “So HR and things like this, the duties of various HR units, largely a lot of the trivial, day-to-day things are being centralized.”
With things like the PEAK initiative, Jones said jobs that are handled by people right now will be handled by chat bots in the future. He added AI will be an economic disruptor over the next five to ten years, as some jobs are erased and new ones are created. 
Rege also said that he sees universities using AI to improve operational efficiency. Whether it’s using AI to see if a student is on the path to graduation or personalized tutors, Rege said AI can be used for more than just teaching lectures.
In this era of being surrounded by intelligence software like AI, Rege said universities are doing their bit to ensure there is a skilled workforce knowledgeable in the use of AI. 
Whether it’s being used in statistics, engineering or English courses, Jones said there is an enormous amount of interest in AI among students, both undergraduate and graduate. 
“It’s here to stay,” Jones said. “It’s not going anywhere, and so we have to teach them how to use it appropriately.”

Editor’s note: The resolution discussed in this story passed 9-3 Thursday with councilors Michael Rainville, LaTrisha Vetaw and Linae Palmisano dissenting. Prior to that vote, the council rejected a motion to delay action on the item and send it to a committee for a public hearing.
The Labor Standards Board resolution that the Minneapolis City Council will vote on Thursday has long been debated but only recently formed into an actual agenda item. 
It’s been two years since the creation of the advisory board was first 
backed by both City Council members and Mayor Jacob Frey
. It’s also drawn opposition from many business owners who believe more oversight by the city government would be damaging. Supporters include workers who say having a seat at the table to discuss business and employee needs would help both employers and their employees. 
 


 


The
 resolution creating the board
 is on Thursday’s City Council agenda, and it appears to have the votes necessary for approval.
Here’s more background in advance of the council’s action: 
The board itself
The board would have 15 members – 12 appointed by the council and three appointed by the mayor. The mayor, while in support of the board, has stated that he believes there should be a
 50/50 split 
between the council and the mayor in the appointment of board members. 
If approved, the board would be made up of an even split between employers, employees and “community stakeholders,” with each group having five seats. The Civil Rights Department would be the city department primarily responsible for supporting the new board. 
The board would be an advisory body, so it would only be bringing recommendations to the council. It would have no power in and of itself to enact or enforce policy. 
 


 


Recommendations also would have to first pass through the board’s “sectoral workgroups” – groups that are focused on employment within a particular business sector. These workgroups, according to the resolution, would make recommendations to the mayor and the City Council as they study wages, benefits, training and working conditions. They also would engage employers, employees and community members. 
In a follow-up email to MinnPost, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office added that the mayor would also like to see the board have a 50/50 split between employees and employers and require a supermajority consensus before bringing recommendations to council. 
“The mayor has long supported a Labor Standards Board that is balanced but the Council’s proposal is not. This lack of balance has led the business community to pull out and not participate. This doesn’t work. The mayor’s position is simple: get participation from both business and labor and pass a balanced board that can benefit good governance,” the spokesperson wrote. 
Timing and lack of a public hearing 
A level of mystery has persisted around the Labor Standards Board despite it being in discussion for years. In October, the Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal was the first news outlet to uncover an early draft of what the board could look like. The first draft resolution wasn’t publicly released until Nov. 3. 
 


 


Dozens of business owners and proponents for the board filled City Council chambers last week during a Public Health and Safety Committee meeting. Many thought there would be a public hearing where they could voice their opinions about the board during that meeting, but that was not the case.

Council members explained that because the board would be created via a resolution, not an ordinance, a public hearing 
would not be part of the process
. That means there has been no official public comment period on the issue since the draft language for the resolution was released. 
With this in mind, during the Nov. 6 committee meeting, council member Linea Palmisano made a motion to delay the resolution to provide time for a public comment period. “With any controversial issue, let’s make sure to follow a transparent and open process,” she said. Palmisano’s motion was voted down by the committee’s majority. 
Instead, council members referred those who want to comment on the board to the council’s 
online public comment forum
 and email. 
 


 


The opposition 
On Tuesday, 82 business owners 
sent a joint letter to the City Council
 urging members to reconsider the Labor Standards Board proposal. Of the signatories on the letter, 23 are business owners of color. 
Much of the opposition to the board stems from business owners who say they’ve already had trouble staying afloat since the pandemic. The letter states that stressors over the past four years have already led to the closure of over 40 restaurants between Minneapolis and St. Paul. The letter lists obstacles and  fears like “the pandemic, record inflation, supply chain problems, public safety threats and concerns, significant increases in city property taxes, road construction on Hennepin and Lake and throughout the city, and now this threat from the Minneapolis City Council – a proposed Labor Standards Board.”
The business owners also stated that they have not been listened to or had an opportunity to provide adequate input on the formation of the board.

“We do not feel that in this process you have listened to us or considered the hardships our businesses face across the city. Instead, this Labor Standards Board proposal has been done behind closed doors and rushed through the process, with only certain interest groups in mind,” the letter stated. 
 


 


David Benowitz, president and co-owner of Craft & Crew Hospitality, told MinnPost that some small businesses in fear of further regulation are considering not renewing their Minneapolis leases once they expire. Two of his restaurant group’s seven restaurants are in Minneapolis.
“We’re looking at sites throughout the Twin Cities right now in terms of expansion, and Minneapolis is not one of them, unfortunately,” Benowitz said. “I wish that wasn’t the case. I do love this city but there are so many things working against us as a small business, and this is just another layer on top of it.” 
The supporters 
Last week, members of Centro De Trabajadores Unidos En La Lucha (CTUL) and SEIU Local 26, along with a group of City Council members that included authors of the Labor Standards Board resolution, visited a local childcare center to talk about the board and workers rights. 
To CTUL member and downtown worker James Steele, the board is not about pitting employees against employers, but rather about creating a space where employees and employers can come together to collaborate. 
“I’ve always found it important for workers, advocate for themselves, but I think working 40 hours a week for Target downtown, that’s what really started pushing me to advocate for workers,” he said. 
Steele said Target was the largest corporation he’s worked for, and he saw a deep power imbalance between employee and employer.

“I definitely felt as though I was being talked down to by a lot of the managers that I had to fight for a lot of things, like hours, pay increases. I really just often had to beg for 40 hours,” he said. 
Steele said he often found himself fighting for a 40-hour work week just so he could make rent, so guaranteed hours are among his top priorities. 
Steele currently works multiple jobs as a barista and bartender in downtown and the North Loop. These current employers have been supportive and have been proactive in providing benefits, raises and a consistent schedule, Steele said. Now, Steele says he wants to help ensure this treatment continues and advocate that fellow workers across the city have support. 
“The Labor Standards Board, it’s really, it’s a really great way to get employees and their employers at the same table, on the most level playing field we can possibly be on to solve the issues together,” he said. “There is this enormous power imbalance between employers and employees. So it’s exciting we’re going to be able to sit at the same table, same advisory board, and work on these issues that come up together.” 
A divided council 
The Labor Standards Board issue has once again shown cracks between the City Council’s progressive majority and more centrist members. At the Nov. 6 committee meeting, council members Palmisano and Michael Rainville spoke out in favor of allowing community comment and reassessing the resolution as a whole. 
Because there would be no public hearing on the topic, Rainville said he wanted to voice on the record what he’s heard from the small-business community in his ward and across the city. 
“In essence, what this is going to do is pit small-business owners against their employees – employees who already have protections under federal, state and city laws… This will do nothing to decrease the amount of empty storefronts in Uptown or downtown,” Rainville said. “The business community has made it clear that when their leases are up, they’re going to leave Minneapolis or simply close their business.” 
Palmisano said she’s been contacted by dozens of local businesses that are “downright fearful” about the board. She asked her fellow council members who authored the resolutions, “What have you learned from small-business owners in your conversations with them?” 
There have been several iterations of conversation with small-business owners both in structured settings and informal settings over the course of the last year, council vice president Aisha Chughtai responded. Chughtai is one of the authors of the Labor Standards Board resolution. 
“The theme that has emerged in common across all of those conversations, at least from my perspective and from the author’s perspective, is a deep fear of what could happen,” Chughtai said. “This fear is that the city government but really government more broadly, doesn’t have the business owner’s backs, is not going to consider policies that help them succeed, survive, thrive, in our local economy. I think a common theme that’s very much so tied to that is that policies or regulations come up in the city and at other levels of government, and it’s like they happen overnight.” 
But Chughtai said she believes these concerns are exactly what the labor standards board would aim to address. 
“We should be soliciting  input and feedback from those who are directly impacted by a new labor regulation to ask for their perspective. That’s what we’re trying to do,” she said. 
Council member Aurin Chowdhury, who also is an author of the resolution, said in her conversations with the business community, specifically the restaurant industry, she has heard that the future feels uncertain. She said business owners told her they don’t want one-size-fits-all policies. 
“And when I heard that, I was like ‘I completely agree with you.’ We don’t want labor standards just popping up out of the air, which is the process that we currently have. I think that is worth stating again,” Chowdhury said. 
The committee meeting was held the day after the election, and some council members argued that a Labor Standards Board at the city level would provide protections for workers that could otherwise be stripped under a federal administration looking to deregulate business. 
Council member Jason Chavez said many community members struggling to get by now “are going to be struggling for the next four years.”
“I just want to level-set here. This is an advisory board. I’m sorry, but the sky is not falling,” Chavez said. “We’re in a moment in our country where we have immigrants in our state, in our city, in our country who feel unsafe in a time in our country where they feel demonized, unsupported and left behind. What a Labor Standards Board does, in this moment – it’s even more (important) in this moment after yesterday’s appalling news.”

This story has also been updated to include further comment from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

On Tuesday, St. Paul voters approved a referendum that will switch local odd-year elections to even years to coincide with elections for wider offices, on the premise that such a move will increase voter turnout for local races. 
Opponents of the change, however, claim it means 
ranked-choice voting could now be eliminated for those local races. 
How likely is that?
 


 


St. Paul, like other cities, has ranked-choice voting for city council seats and other local positions
, unlike non-local races generally held on even years, such as those on the ballot for Tuesday’s general election. Now, with local elections moved to even years, election officials will either have to produce 
two sets of ballots or a single ballot that contains both traditional voting for one set of candidates and ranked choice voting for others. 
Additionally, because of conflicting state laws, it is unclear if the city could have two second-page ballots. 
Peter Butler, a longtime advocate for St. Paul elections moving to even years, said there is no law “expressly” prohibiting ranked-choice voting on even-year elections, though the “laws are a little inconsistent and in conflict.”

A law concerning optical scanning equipment, the most commonly used election tabulation tool, says only a single ballot card can be used, Butler said. But Butler said it doesn’t completely eliminate the ability for ranked-choice voting to be included on even years; it just makes it more difficult to do so. A 2017 report by a Minneapolis city attorney also
 outlined this paradoxical nature of current law,
 concluding it would be particularly difficult to have ranked-choice voting on even years. 
“Some of the law says it’s OK to go to a second page and then you have this optical scanner law that says you can only have a single page,” he said. 
 


 


This legal gray area could be remedied if St. Paul moved to the latest touch screen technology on the market for polling places, Butler added. He also sent a timeline of even-year election efforts in the United States to MinnPost, including the 2022 even-year election for mayor and city council in Los Angeles, which reached “some 43%” of the 2.1 million registered voters, as compared to prior Los Angeles city elections that had lower turnout. Karen Bass, the first Black woman to be elected mayor of Los Angeles, was elected in this even-year race.

But opponents of the ballot measure have said it puts additional strains on election infrastructure without dedicated funding to ensure voter access.  
City Council President Mitra Jalali was one of these opponents. She said there are myriad policy issues to contend with now that it has passed. 
 


 


“It’s not good for (the) voters that you say you’re trying to help,” Jalali said. “I just think these are things that, frankly, they just did not contemplate. They were like, ‘Wouldn’t it be nice if so many more people voted in local elections? All you have to do is change the year.’ Well it turns out there are a whole lot of issues with that operationally.”
 


 


State Rep. Liz Lee, DFL-St. Paul, also opposed the ballot questions. She believes local candidates will have a harder time getting their message out over the din of national and gubernatorial elections. 
Rep. Liz Lee
“Unfortunately, that means we have to work even harder to help folks understand what they’re voting for,” she said. “I also worry that new folks voted ‘yes’ for this but also weren’t sure what they were voting for.” 
For Butler, the timing of when this initiative went to voters was intentional after lessons learned from his first attempt. 
The first effort Butler made to change these election years was in 2016 in response to the city having one of its lowest odd-year election turnouts in 2015. Only around 30,000 people voted. He noted that turnout hasn’t been as low in the most recent odd-year elections, which he attributed to prominent ballot initiatives that spurred voters to go to the polls, including a trash collection initiative in 2019 and rent control in 2021. 
 


 


“But in 2015 we had some seriously low turnout and I thought, ‘This is kind of ridiculous,’” he said. “Nobody shows up. We have an election every year in St. Paul. It’s city elections on odd years and state and federal elections on even years. Why don’t we just combine them?”
In 2016, Butler was unable to get enough signatures to get the referendum on the ballot. He then committed to doing it again and decided 2024 would be the time to do it, based on the number of signatures needed to place a referendum on a ballot. 
“That way, you’re presenting the question to the highest turnout and the number of signatures is based on 5% of the last even-year election. So it was based on 2022, so that was about 5,500. It could have been based on 2020, but that would’ve been 7,700. So I had to wait a couple years to get the lower number.”

Various local referendums across the state were in front of Minnesota voters Tuesday. 
Some significant ballot measures passed, including one in St. Paul that will switch local odd-year elections to even years and a Minneapolis Public Schools technology levy increase. Meanwhile, St. Paul voters shot down a child care tax proposal that the city’s mayor 
strongly opposed
, saying it over-promised and would have under-delivered.
Here’s more on what happened: 
 


 


St. Paul 
St. Paul voters voted against a referendum that would have given the mayor the ability to employ an early child care tax that could have ramped up to $20 million per year up to $110 million over a decade. The initiative was defeated with nearly 60% “no” votes.

Even if voters had passed it, Mayor Melvin Carter had said he 
would not have implemented
 the levy increase. Carter said the ballot language was misleading because the amount of money raised by the levy wouldn’t be enough to cover everything outlined in it for all low-income families.
 


 


The second ballot initiative in front of St. Paul voters did pass. It will take St. Paul’s odd-year city elections and move them to even years. The initiative passed 61%-39%. Advocates for this move said it would capture more voters during higher voter turnout years while also eliminating some city spending related to off-year elections. Opponents have pointed out that, under current state law, the move would eliminate ranked-choice voting. They also have said it would dilute the focus odd-year elections bring to local issues.
Schools 
There were 54 referendums by state school districts asking voters to increase funding by approving local tax levies or increased tax levies. 
Of those, 31 passed and 23 failed. 
 


 


Among these initiatives approved was an increase to a Minneapolis Public School technology levy. Voters passed a $20 million increase that will bring the levy to a total of $38 million over the next 10 years. The initiative was approved 66%-34%. 
School officials have said 
the original levy does not cover all of the district’s technology expenditures and that the district has pulled from its general fund in the past to offset that.
 With an expanded tax, the district says it can use the general fund dollars otherwise used on technology for other purposes, including operations.
In a Q&A with MinnPost earlier this year,
 Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams said the levy would be a “big part” of the district’s budget strategy.

I
n the last half-decade, college athletics has been upended by lawsuits and court rulings that have pushed the NCAA to allow student-athlete compensation from outside entities (known as Name-Image-Likeness or “NIL”), and the 
NCAA recently authorized universities to compensate athletes directly
. The NCAA has also made player movement between universities easier through a new “transfer portal,” which allows them to maintain eligibility while, conceivably, moving from school to school every year of their college careers. (In the past, athletes lost a year of eligibility each time they transferred.)
Although college athletics has never been a level playing field, with boosters long accused of surreptitiously funneling money to football and basketball players, the recent changes are adding a Wild West aspect, rooted in the disparities brought on by NIL.
NIL stands for name, image, likeness and allows local sponsors to compensate athletes for marketing endorsements. In major university markets, private collectives have formed to raise money and sponsor athletes with NIL funds. Though it was thought that the NIL universe would benefit athletes playing in the larger media markets, like the Twin Cities, that hasn’t necessarily been the case.

Rent control is on the St. Paul City Council’s agenda once again

St. Paul City Council disagreement reaches boiling point behind closed doors
 






 


“Why didn’t NIL work?” asks Cale Johnston, serial entrepreneur and the founder of banking app ClickSWITCH (
which sold to Q2 Holdings in 2021 for $65 million
). “The Gophers should be signing all the best players with all the Fortune 500s here. But instead, Columbus [Ohio State University] is winning.” Johnston says OSU has raked in $35 million in NIL funds, while the University of Minnesota has attracted a fraction of that.
Johnston, a fan, was frustrated by the richest college athletics programs getting richer, and he started noodling on a tech solution—“I wanted to do something about a problem everyone just wants to complain about.” His creation, 
Roy
, is a crowdfunding app that allows fans to overcome the NIL system’s greatest limitation—the effectiveness of local collectives in raising money.
 


 


Roy (which stands for “return on you”) debuted in August and allows fans to dedicate monies to a specific player to cement them to their university. To deal with the real risk of said player entering the transfer portal, Roy uses a banking solution to incentivize stability. “If I want to give [Gopher running back] Darius Taylor $10, it sits in a settlement account until he commits to stay in Minnesota,” Johnston explains. “Our approach returns the money if a player leaves. They only get 25% with a commitment. They are paid out over a year to keep them committed. There is full transparency.
“We actually try to obviate the need for the player to enter the portal.”
 


 


Roy hopes to have 100,000 users and $10 million in deposits by December. Though it’s starting with football and basketball, it will be adding wrestling, hockey, baseball, and women’s volleyball as those sports’ seasons begin.
Though Johnston believes local collectives will see Roy as a threat, he says Roy would be happy to partner with them. Roy might be a banking solution, but its challenge is basically a marketing one. Roy needs fan awareness and that of the agent community now that college athletes can have representation.
The Roy app. A finger does all the work.
Johnston says he raised $20 million for ClickSWITCH and that the VCs and angels who invested saw “a fantastic return.” Local investor Reed Robinson is one of Roy’s early funders. “I like Cale’s approach because I think this is a banking problem and he’s a fintech guy,” Robinson told 
TCB
. “Will the talent choose to use their network? That’s going to be the challenge for everyone in this space. There is money flying everywhere.”
Johnston admits Roy could also end up “a spectacular failure” if fans are indifferent. His hope is to convince them that a DraftKings/fantasy league-type platform—where small investments give them a stake in player outcomes—is worth a look.
 


 


Just prior to launch, St. Louis Park-based Roy had 10 employees and $2 million in seed funding for marketing. Johnston expects to spend it on podcasts, radio, and in-stadium ads. He also hopes to reach influencers to evangelize Roy’s message.
“It’s a big bet, undeniably,” he says. “We’re going to Vegas and putting it all on red.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter have both made headlines this month for basically saying they would ignore city council override votes of their vetoes.
That 
turned some heads
 and certainly angered some city council members, but both mayors insist they would have legal grounding for choosing not to implement policy as instructed by their city councils. 
Both cases are very different from each other. In St. Paul, Carter is looking at a ballot referendum involving taxes to support child care, while in Minneapolis, Frey was reacting to new carbon emissions fees.
 


 


In both cases, though, the two mayors have appeared to say something rare: That they simply would not implement what’s been put in front of them. Meanwhile, the details of each case show how a mayor’s power is tested in 
Minneapolis and St. Paul’s unique “strong mayor” systems
 because, ultimately, these mayors head the city departments that would need to implement what their councils want done. 
The case in St. Paul
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter wants St. Paul voters to look closely at the ballot language of a referendum proposing a citywide early child care tax before them in this November general election. He says it’s misleading. 
The ballot language states “shall the City of Saint Paul be authorized to levy property taxes in the amount of…” It goes on to outline a schedule ramping up the levy to a total of $20 million per year. This would amount to a total of $110 million over a decade. 
But Carter wants voters to note the word “authorized.” If passed, Carter argues, the initiative would simply give him the power to implement the outlined tax — if he chooses to do so. And the mayor is saying he will choose 
not to
 do so regardless of the referendum’s outcome. 
 


 


“Possessing the authorization would be honoring the will of the voters. … Authorizing a thing and directing a thing to be done are two different things,” he said in an interview with MinnPost.  
The money levied is meant to “create a dedicated fund for children’s early care and education to be administered by a City department or office that provides subsidies to families and providers so that early care and education is no cost to low-income families and available on a sliding scale to other families, and so as to increase the number of child care slots and support the child care workforce.”

Carter says even if voters approve the measure and the city moves forward with it, the measure would overpromise and underdeliver, because the amount of money raised by the levy wouldn’t be enough to cover everything. That makes it misleading, he said. 
“It would be like if you ordered a pizza and the delivery driver brought you two slices even though you paid for the whole pizza,” Carter said.
 


 


Carter pointed to a 2017 report the referendum was originally based on, which concluded that it would cost $39 million to close the child care gap in St. Paul for low-income infants and toddlers under 2 years old. The ballot question doubles the number of children and adds policy promises for children ages 2-4. But  the property tax proposed collects a maximum of $20 million per year.
“My assertion would be that in order to make a difference, in order to justify a set of policy investments in this ballot question, you would have to fully deliver on the promises that it makes, and if you’re going to partially deliver the promises and still expect to charge taxpayers the full amount of money, that would require a new conversation,” he said. 
The St. Paul City Council originally passed the referendum in August of 2023. Current council president Mitra Jalali and former council member Russel Balenger, voted against it. Carter vetoed the measure last year, but his veto was ultimately overruled. 
Carter has remained in staunch opposition to the implementation of this tax. In a letter to the St. Paul City Council this month, Carter stated, “as I have communicated over the past year, my administration must respectfully decline to propose, plan, staff, and/or implement programming pursuant to the outcome of this referendum.”
 


 


“Some advocates, I think to avoid a detailed level of discussion, just want to say, ‘Oh, the mayor just isn’t going to accept the will of the voters,’ is inaccurate,” Carter said.  
Council member Rebecca Noecker, one of the proposal’s sponsors, was not available for comment for this story. But she told Axios last week that voters “completely understand that this is like every other public program in existence,” Noecker said. “It’s not going to have funding to cover every single child who’s eligible.”
Carter does not believe voters will understand this.
Noecker also contended that a supermajority of council members could overrule the mayor on this topic. 
 


 


To this Carter asked: “Overrule what?” Because the mayor said he is not actually saying no to something. Rather, if the referendum is passed, he said he’s choosing to simply not to use power he could be granted.
 


 


The case in Minneapolis 
There’s a difference between a mayor and city staff saying they won’t do something and a mayor saying they can’t do something. In Minneapolis’ case, it was a situation where Frey said his staff couldn’t implement a council-passed ordinance on carbon emissions fees legally. Therefore, Frey said the city just wouldn’t do it on the council’s desired timeline unless amendments were made, explained mayor’s office spokesperson Ally Peters.
“We’re not in the business of implementing illegal fees,” she said.  
Of the council’s original ordinance to address carbon emission fees, Frey said: “As City staff have repeatedly said, all of this cannot happen by January 31. Therefore, the City cannot legally implement a fee by January 31, and will not do so, even if the Council overrides the mayor’s veto on Thursday.”
Before the fees can be implemented legally, Frey’s office said a new program must be created, businesses and stakeholders consulted, positions for the program posted and staff hired. The mayor also said city attorneys have been clear such a fee needs an accompanying ordinance requiring registration or an established regulatory program.
Last week, the council overrode the mayor’s veto. But it was an amended version — modified in a way Frey’s office said would make it possible for the city to legally implement. Specifically, they extended the fee’s implementation time from Jan. 31 to July 1. The council also brought forward an ordinance to establish a funds system within the city’s health department.  
“It’s still very quick. It’s still going to be a large task, but that hopefully helps with some of those legality and just holistic issues that we were running into here,” Peters said. “Yes, even if the City Council had kept their ordinance the same, kept that Jan. 31, the city was not going to start charging companies fees on Jan. 31 without a program set up, no matter what they did.”
The fee will charge businesses $452 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. Last year, the Minneapolis City Council passed a climate plan that looks to reduce the city’s emissions by 75% by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. 
Are the mayors right? Or are there legal implications here?
In these cases, it’s important to note that the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul have significantly more power than the average mayor of a small city would, said League of Minnesota Cities research manager Amber Eisenschenk. 
But in general, especially in small cities, Eisenschenk said the League of Minnesota Cities always tells cities “don’t have ordinances that you can’t enforce or implement,” because it can lead to legal problems. 
“Usually, we’re talking about that coming in through the litigation process of someone creating a lawsuit for the city to act in the way that it says it’s going to act,” she said. “But if the council were trying to implement an ordinance that the mayor has gotten legal advice that says this is an illegal ordinance, I certainly think that most mayors in that situation are going to say, ‘No, I’m not going to implement that.’” 
Minneapolis and St. Paul are both charter cities with strong mayors.
 This adds complexity when it comes to the legal role of councils and mayors, Eisenschenk said. Charter cities essentially have their own constitution, while non-charter cities (otherwise known as statutory cities) operate within state law. 
“I think we’re looking at two really large cities with lots of needs, with a lot of really passionate people running these organizations who have great ideas for improving the quality of life of their community,” she said. “Sometimes progress is a little slower than what we want, than what our residents want.”

Food entrepreneurs will soon have a new resource in north Minneapolis: a more conveniently located commercial kitchen.
Northside Economic Opportunity Network (NEON) broke ground on the site of its collective kitchen space last week. For entrepreneurs including food truck owners and caterers, the upcoming commercial kitchen space means closer, more affordable space to prepare food. 
Forty percent of NEON’s clients are food entrepreneurs, said Warren McClean, NEON’s chief executive officer.
 


 


“Our clients will no longer have to drive three hours one way to Wisconsin for commercial kitchen space, as Michael Feng currently does,” McLean added. 
Feng and his wife, Michelle Wang, run BianDang, a food truck serving Taiwanese bian dang, which are boxed meals of meat and vegetables, served over a bed of rice. Bian dang are a staple of the Taiwanese railroad, which was further developed and expanded under the 50-year Japanese occupation of the island from 1895 to 1945. Bian dang, or bento, as the Japanese referred to them, were sold in train stations all over Taiwan as a convenient meal option, Feng said.

“Every time we (left) school (in Taiwan), there (was) a small vendor outside the school. So we (would) ask our mom or our parents, ‘Can we get some wheel cake for dessert?’” Wang said. The cakes, Wang added, have led to repeat customers at the Minnesota Farmer’s Market, who ask whether the treats will be at the Minnesota State Fair in the future. 
 


 


Feng’s own goal for BianDang is to eventually grow into a fast casual chain restaurant along the lines of Chipotle or Panda Express. A crucial part of growing the business, however, is having the space to prepare ingredients for the food truck, like crispy popcorn chicken, pickled radish and sweet-and-savory Taiwanese grilled sausage.

Commercial kitchen space was already scarce before the pandemic and the 2020 uprising following George Floyd’s murder. The Kindred Kitchen, run by Appetite for Change, had been a space for food entrepreneurs, McClean said, including NEON clients, to prepare food for their businesses in North Minneapolis. But the events of 2020 led to Appetite for Change pivoting its business model, resulting in a lack of kitchen space, he said.

“(NEON’s commercial kitchen incubator is) going to provide a closer proximity commercial kitchen (that is) hopefully, more easily accessible and budget friendly,” said Feng, who added that traveling to Wisconsin for kitchen space had been the lowest-cost option.

Another business ready to utilize NEON’s space is K’s Revolutionary Catering and More, which offers catering services with a variety of options, along with locally brewed “Stay Well” tonic with antioxidants and antiviral properties. 
 


 


 


 


Chef K Taylor and Mariam Omari, the co-founders of K’s, said they have focused their operations on “real food” instead of “manufactured or processed food.” For example, Chef Taylor uses  whole potatoes instead of potato powder. Taylor and Omari worked in the food industry for many years, but were unsatisfied with the use of what Omari calls “fluff” – preservatives and filler ingredients. Their menu is inclusive and wide-ranging, with gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian options, along with foods from various cultures. The most popular item, however, is a staple of Omari’s childhood: maharagwe, an East African dish of red beans simmered in ginger and coconut milk, along with various spices. 
“Meat eaters and plant based people alike love it,” Taylor said.

“It really adheres to a lot of cultures,” Omari added. “Everybody has red beans and rice no matter where you come from. And the coconut milk really infuses Asian, East Indian (and) African cultures and then the beans (and) some of those spices really adhere to our Latin and African American friends. This meal is a gatherer.”
While Taylor and Omari do not want to make K’s a restaurant, they are eager to utilize the commercial kitchen as a means to expand their ventures and also  have a space to teach and help other food business owners “avoid the bumps in the road.” 
 


 


“This will be an opportunity for us to be a little closer to our supporters and people that we support,” Omari said. 
Once the commercial kitchen space is fully operational, it will support 265 jobs in north Minneapolis, along with space for K’s Revolutionary Catering and BianDang to expand in the ways they want to. At the core of both businesses, however, is the same desire – to give their customers good, delicious food. 
“I wanna stay true to authentic Taiwanese food because that’s the food that I ate growing up. And I want people to be able to try and enjoy the same authentic (food) that I had,” Feng said. 
“When we have our guests (or) any of our clients, regardless of whoever’s in their party, we wanna really make sure that everybody feels like they’re breaking bread together,” Omari said.

The city of Minneapolis doesn’t own or use razor wire, yet it still wraps around the former Third Precinct police station.
“Most public-facing agencies don’t use razor wire,” City Operations Officer Margaret Anderson Kelliher  said. “It’s very unsafe. It’s meant to be a real barrier and could cause some real harm both to the people putting it up and people if they came over it.” 
The razor wire securing the badly damaged Third Precinct building is a remnant left by the National Guard, which came into the city following the civil unrest that broke out after the murder of George Floyd. It’s also become a backdrop in the 2024 campaign as Republicans portray it as a symbol of the mayhem they blame on Minnesota governor and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz.
 


 


During the unrest after Floyd’s murder, the Guard placed barbed coils around most city police precincts, Anderson Kelliher said. In most cases, it has been removed since. 
Meanwhile, remediation efforts at the former Third Precinct building in south Minneapolis began this spring. So why hasn’t the exterior changed over the last several months? 
When city staff set out to clean up the site, making the interior of the building safe was their first priority, Anderson Kelliher said. The idea was that the exterior barriers to the building could come down completely once the interior was safe and secure. 
But there were delays in finding qualified vendors from the city’s target market list to do smoke remediation work. Two firms eventually responded to the bid, but it was eventually determined that they could not do the work. There also were delays in obtaining custom glass and extruded steel needed for the building’s doorways and window frames.
 


 


Meanwhile, the razor wire, j-barrier and fencing around the property has become political fodder for Republican politicians. Earlier this month, former President Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, U.S. Sen. JD Vance, used the site for an appearance to paint Minneapolis as a dangerous place to live. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson also used the site as a backdrop for an August news conference.

Minneapolis City Council to take pivotal vote on the future of the former Third Precinct 
 










 






Critical St. Paul housing issues motivate new interim City Council member
 










 






Rent control is on the St. Paul City Council’s agenda once again
 






 


Last week, just days after Vance appeared in front of the precinct, the City Council voted 8-3 to approve a resolution for the “immediate cleanup, remediation, and beautification of the 3000 Minnehaha site including but not limited to the removal of fencing, jersey barriers, barbed wire, and all other exterior blight.”
This cleanup was already happening, Anderson Kelliher noted. But with the council’s action, the city operations office will now change its order of operations. Within the next two weeks, the razor wire, J barriers and fencing will come down, she said. 
However, it will not look completely remediated after this phase, Anderson Kelliher noted. The razor wire will be replaced by construction fencing that will be pushed back closer to the building. This is a “compromise solution,” she said, as the city is not yet able to fully remove all the exterior barriers until the interior of the building can be fully secured. 
 


 


The goal of the next two weeks is to make it look more like a construction site and “less of what it’s looked like for the last four-plus years,” she said. 
Anderson Kelliher said the action did not come in response to the Vance visit. 
“It’s more that we are listening to our elected policy makers here and the community about how that razor wire, j-barrier and fencing feels, and really trying to find a solution that’s going to be more welcoming,” she said. 
Another angle on Lake Street 
If JD Vance had turned the cameras to look down Lake Street, the shot would have captured the recently remodeled and reopened century-old Coliseum Building at the corner of East Lake Street and 27th Ave. S. The 85,000-square-foot, mixed-use building reopened after a $28 million rehab. The project looks to make the location a hub for people-of-color-owned businesses. 
 


 


Chris Montana, co-owner of the Du Nord Cocktail Room and the new Lagniappe restaurant in the Coliseum Building, was one of the first to open a business in the building. The Du Nord Cocktail Room is the “spiritual successor” to the original Du Nord distillery, the nation’s first Black-owned distillery, which closed because of the pandemic in 2020 and stayed closed after it was damaged during the civil unrest after Floyd’s murder.

Now, Montana can see the former Third Precinct building when he walks out of his newly reopened cocktail room and newly opened restaurant. He called the building a “large monument to our most recent time.” 
As for the razor wire, Montana said: “I don’t know what we’re protecting with that barbed wire. We want the area to be inviting. We want businesses to come back, and I think they’re less likely to do that when we have barbed wire and fencing.” 
At the same time, the building is a part of history, and the business owner said it will take time to figure out what it will become. 
 


 


“I think that it makes sense for it to be a public space,” he said. “I also think that it makes sense for it to be a public space that is inclusive and not just about one group of people and their experience, particularly one group of people and their experience with the Minneapolis police. I say that as a Black man.” 
Council decided last year police would not return to the site
. This year, the city proposed that the former site become a  “democracy center” with 8,000 square feet of community use space on the ground floor. This proposal
 garnered backlash from some council members earlier this year
, but the city has moved forward with community engagement on its proposed plan.  
“I really don’t mind what they’re proposing,” Montana said. “I think that there is something empowering about it being a space that helps people in the city vote. And I kind of love that. And if there’s going to be some other spaces for people to use it and gather and all discuss  I mean personally from a business perspective, we’ve always taken the angle that more discussion is better. Creating public spaces where people can get together is always a better solution than something that’s walled off or you turn into some sort of museum exhibit where you walk through and don’t talk. I’d like to see it be used.” 
While the former Third Precinct building remains in the remediation and planning phase, Montana noted that the Coliseum Building stands as an example of what can be accomplished through community and partnership. 
Funding for the building’s $28 million rehab and remodel came from a mix of private and public players including New Markets Tax Credits, historic tax credits, a Property Assessed Clean Energy loan, philanthropic donations and a variety of grants. Nonprofit Redesign Inc. managed the project with a range of community partners. 
“In the time frame that this election is going to happen, we’re not going to be able to turn the Third Precinct from what it has been for the past four years into some beautiful monument to progress,” Montana said. “But I think if JD Vance had turned around, he would have looked across the street, he would have seen that buildings have been rebuilt, economic activity is coming back. And the reason for that — we’re a perfect example, I think — of how government and private organizations can come together to make something happen… That is a story I’d rather tell.”

Much of downtown Minneapolis is subject to a special 3% liquor, lodging and restaurant tax. But as downtown continues to see a declining office and retail market, the city has looked to expand the district into the North Loop, where development and entertainment have boomed in comparison to other neighborhoods and the city’s core. 
As Minneapolis faces the crunch of declining post-pandemic commercial property tax revenues, it’s worth asking why the burgeoning North Loop isn’t included in a special tax district that’s been in place for years elsewhere in downtown. 
The district’s boundary currently ends along the Burlington Northern Railroad tracks just northwest of Target Field. This means most of the bustling North Loop’s restaurants, bars and storefronts aren’t included in the downtown sales tax district. For example, the tax is applied at Fairgrounds Coffee and Tea on North Second Street but is not collected at Egg on a Roll at the other end of the same block. 
 


 


In last year’s legislative agenda, Minneapolis sought to expand the district. House Bill HF 3715, authored by Rep. Esther Agbaje, and its companion Senate bill, SF 4243 authored by Sen. Scott Dibble, would have amended the boundaries. But the bills were ultimately referred to the Legislature’s property tax committee and never moved past that stage.

St. Paul mayor’s veto timing prevents a City Council override — again

The district would have been expanded on the northwest through the North Loop, with the new cutoff at Plymouth Avenue North. It also would have been expanded on its southeast side into Elliot Park. This legislation also would have reduced the maximum 3% levy to a 2.5% maximum, at least for liquor and food. Lodging and hotel taxes would have remained at 3%. Revenue from the tax is used for economic development. 
It 
wasn’t the only legislation
 that didn’t make the cut before the session ended. Many remaining bills were placed in a
 1,430-page omnibus bill in less than 10 minutes in the House and 15 in the Senate
.
“A lot of the stuff that we were trying to do got cut in order to make the deadline,” Agbaje said. “We’ll probably take another crack at this again. I’m still having conversations with the city.” 
 


 


Officials are still looking to make the expanded district revenue neutral, Agbaje noted. While some tax levies for infrastructure projects get put to a vote via ballot referendum, this is not a case where that would happen, she clarified. 
Revenue from the tax district doesn’t directly offset resident property tax burdens, which is notable in a year Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is proposing a 8.1% increase in 2025 property taxes. Rather, money from this district 
is funneled into the city’s general fund.
 The tax was created in 
2013 to help finance the construction of the U.S. Bank Stadium. 
At that time, the North Loop looked very different, Agbaje added. 
 


 


“When it first started, there wasn’t a whole lot in the North Loop area, but as the North Loop grew and expanded, they wanted to bring it into the North Loop area,” Agbaje said of the sales tax. “It’s an ongoing conversation over what’s included in downtown Minneapolis."" 
 


 


The U.S. Bank Stadium project funding was meant to wrap in 2020. While the state has completed its payments on the project, the city “does still have an obligation to U.S. Bank,” Agbaje said. 
Minneapolis is in the process of evaluating its legislative agenda and policies to determine what may need to be changed ahead of next year’s session, according to a city statement sent to MinnPost.  
“This is a staff and elected official process that will conclude before the end of the year,” the statement read. “Our legislative ask last session was to expand the special restaurant and liquor tax downtown boundary while lowering the tax rate, with the net result being revenue neutral. The city is currently evaluating whether this position is still beneficial for the city, or if this legislative ask should be modified in some way.”
Last week, the president of the Board of Estimate and Taxation (BET), Steve Brandt, was taking time to refamiliarize himself with the city’s tax system when he said he saw the map at the bottom of the 
state’s revenue sheet for Minneapolis’ special local taxes 
“and I thought ‘Woah, we leave out a lot of territory between restaurants and liquor establishments.’” 
 


 


Brandt asked why and learned the city had been seeking the expansion of this district, at least to the North Loop. He said a case could also be made to include the area around Surdyk’s at University and Central Avenue in Northeast and even into Cedar-Riverside. 
“It just struck me as an equity issue,” Brandt said. “If establishments downtown are already paying the tax, and you’ve got people two blocks away who aren’t, it seems like what’s good for one would be good for another.”

More Minnesota cities are turning to utility customers to fund climate and sustainability projects.
The Twin Cities suburb of Eagan is among the latest municipalities to begin collecting what’s known as a “franchise fee” from gas and electric companies in exchange for allowing pipelines, power lines and other infrastructure in public rights-of-way. The charges are typically passed on to customers in the form of a small monthly line item on their utility bills.
As is the case with a growing number of cities, Eagan leaders last year decided to dedicate funds from its franchise fees toward its climate and sustainability efforts. It hired its first sustainability coordinator and is drafting a climate action plan that will be implemented in part with the expected $1.5 million in annual franchise fee revenue.
 


 


“It’s hard to launch a sustainability initiative without a way to sustain it,” said Gillian Catano, the city’s sustainability coordinator. “This helps us with long-term planning and allows us to work on projects supporting our operations and to support projects in the community.”
Use of franchise fees growing
Cities have collected franchise fees from public utilities for decades, but today the charges are emerging as a potentially important revenue source to help budget-strapped local governments make progress toward climate targets. In the Twin Cities, Minneapolis has long used the fees to fund sustainability work, and St. Paul is considering a plan to do the same. Other examples include the suburbs of Edina and Hopkins.

“We’ve seen a growing number of cities, across Minnesota and nationally, leveraging utility franchise fees as a tool to fund climate action and sustainability efforts,” said Julia Eagles, associate director of utility and regulatory strategy for the Institute for Market Transformation, a national nonprofit that promotes public policy to reduce building emissions. “It reflects a broader shift towards cities seeking stable, locally controlled funding sources for urgent climate priorities.”
A National Renewable Energy Laboratory research paper in 2021 found over 3,600 municipalities collect franchise fees from their utilities and 13% use part of that money for clean energy-related projects. The work being funded by franchise fees include energy efficiency programs, municipal fleet electrification, solar panel installations, and other clean energy-related investments. 
 


 


Abby Finis, a consultant who works with local governments on climate action, said in the past, many cities added the fees into the general fund to pay for various city services. What’s different now, she said, is that more communities are tying them to sustainability staff and projects.
“The franchise fee is something that’s already set up, and you can increase it a little bit without hurting people’s wallets too much,” Finis said.
However, Finis cautioned that the money doesn’t “get anywhere near the amount needed to reach our goals.”
Sometimes cities are maximizing those dollars by using them to leverage additional funds, such as through the federal Inflation Reduction Act or Minnesota’s ECO (Energy Conservation and Optimization) Act, she said.
 


 


How other cities are using funds
Minneapolis uses its franchise fees to fund a unique partnership between the city and utilities Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s research highlighted the partnership, which was intended to accelerate progress toward the city’s climate goals but has faced questions about its effectiveness. The city increased its franchise fee in 2023, a per-household increase of about $12 per year, according to Patrick Hanlon, the city’s deputy coordinator for sustainability. 
“It was a pretty minimal increase for residential customers,” Hanlon said. Projects funded partly by franchise fees have saved city residents more than $150 million annually in energy costs and helped weatherize more than 5,000 low-income units, he added. 
Hanlon is also mayor of the nearby suburb of Hopkins, which recently started using its franchise fees to pay for solar, e-bike and electric vehicle charging initiatives.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter recently proposed charging residential franchise fees to fund weatherization, tree planting, and pay the salary of a new climate action coordinator.
 


 


In the past, St. Paul’s climate action budget has come from general funds and grants. 
“This would be the first uniquely dedicated funding for the city’s broad portfolio of climate work,” said Russ Stark, the city’s chief resilience officer.
Edina began using franchise fees for clean energy projects in 2015. Today, according to sustainability manager Marisa Bayer, the suburb receives about $950,000 annually from franchise fees, most of which is invested in city operations to improve efficiency, add renewable energy, and electrify municipal buildings and transportation. The money also funds a sustainable building ordinance and other policy measures.
“The great thing is that because we have this dedicated funding source, we can move forward with projects, either identified in our capital improvement plans or supported by our community,” Bayer said. “We don’t have to go to council every year or rely solely on grants to help fund this work.”

Shawn Holster, president and chair of the Minneapolis Republican Party, is a born and raised southerner — at least mostly, he says. 
“I was raised across the continental United States. I was not a military brat. I was an industry brat. My family built factories and we moved every six months,” he said. 
Related | Hunting for common ground in Houston County
But in 1999, Holster, a lifelong Republican, found himself settling down in Minneapolis, a deeply liberal city. As for what brought Holster to settle in Minneapolis? “It was the furthest thing from New Orleans,” where he’d lived for a decade prior to his move. 
 


 


“What I liked about the Twin Cities when I moved here back in 1999 was not seeing it devolve into the New Orleans of the 1990s,” Holster said. “I came here because I didn’t want the violence. I didn’t want the corruption. I didn’t want to have to lock my doors three times over. I had to do that in New Orleans. It was a … war zone. I didn’t have to do that in Minnesota. Now, I’m starting to have to do that in Minnesota and I don’t like it.”

More red than meets the eye
In a recent MinnPost poll, Harris secured a substantial majority of the support (73% to Trump’s 21%) in Minneapolis and St. Paul. But Holster, who notably is a Minnesota GOP state party 
staffer
, said he still believes there’s more city Republicans excited to vote than the polls reflect. He believes the area could vote Republican “if they had the right candidate.” He also believes Donald Trump is that candidate. 
“On every economic and practical metric, Trump is hands down the choice,” Holster said. “It is because of the kitchen table issues that those who were unable to admit to themselves or their friends previously that they might vote Republican are losing that resistance. They're saying, ‘No, I'm just voting Trump.’” 
Notably, Holster lives in south Minneapolis’ Third Precinct, which shapes much of his priorities in both local and national politics. The Third Precinct is where much of the civil unrest after George Floyd was killed in 2020 culminated. 
 


 


“During the George Floyd riots an individual came in through our front door one morning and I never felt happier about holding a Stevens-model 12 gauge in my hand at that moment,” Holster said. “They reconsidered their decisions. I didn’t have to pull the trigger and they left my house immediately.” 
 


 


Earlier this year, before Gov. Tim Walz was tapped as Kamala Harris’ running mate, Trump claimed Minnesota could flip red this year. Holster still thinks this is possible. The Minneapolis Republican Party launched only 18 months ago as Holster saw a rise in interest in the Republican Party post 2020. The group was formed after the consolidation of multiple Republican groups in the area. Now, Holster says city Republicans are more unified. 
As for how Holster feels about Walz being picked as the Harris running mate, he says, “Tim Walz, why did you let my neighborhood burn for four days?” He says Walz being picked “stings hard” and he’s a “little bitter about Tim.”
Relating to neighbors 
Despite living in an area that has predominantly voted blue, Holster said in his day-to-day life his neighbors don’t talk politics. For example, Holster said his next door neighbor is the director of a “large liberal nonprofit organization.”
 


 


“We get along famously because we don't talk politics,” he said. “We know who each other are. We just don’t play the game. We don’t let that drive how we interact with one another. We don’t let that drive how we behave toward one another as neighbors.” 
In Minneapolis, conservatives often feel that if they show they are conservative or Republican in a forward facing way, they will be attacked for it, Holster said, noting this fear comes from his fellow conservative voters experiencing vandalism, threats and violence. However, this has not been Holster’s experience living in south Minneapolis. 
“I've had a Trump sign in my front yard for the earliest I can get right and I haven’t had a single brick through my window,” Holster said. “I haven't had my tires slashed, haven't had the house broken into, haven’t had the yard sign stolen. Nothing happened. There have been no threats of violence.”
Overall, as a Republican speaking in a generally Democratic-voting area, Holster said he wants people who disagree with him to know: “We’re not evil. We’re your neighbors. We’re Republicans and we’re just like you. We have the same concerns. We have the same issues, but we’re all in trouble right now at the civic level.”
 


 


Update: This story has been updated to reflect that Shawn Holster is a Minnesota GOP state party staffer.

This story was originally published by 
Twin Cities Business
.
 


Downtown St. Paul comes alive with excitement on nights when 18,000 
Minnesota Wild
 fans stream into the capital city to watch an NHL hockey game. Wearing their green and red jerseys, many patronize area bars and restaurants before or after the Wild’s 41 home games. The Wild bring vitality to the area surrounding the 
Xcel Energy Center
. But that high energy is absent on many days and nights in much of downtown. And in 2024, there’s been a constant drumbeat of ominous headlines emanating from downtown.
Some businesses, including the 
TKDA engineering firm with about 300 employees
, are 
leaving
. U.S. Bank didn’t renew its lease for 
nine floors of office space in the U.S. Bank Center
. Many state and other public employees like to work from home, so remote and hybrid work has driven the closure of skyway businesses.
Civic leaders acknowledge downtown has become a magnet for homeless and addicted people, and some visitors don’t feel safe when they witness drug deals, panhandling, or criminal behavior on light-rail. Unless they’re attending a major event where there will be safety in numbers, some people say they are choosing to bypass downtown St. Paul because they don’t want to be hassled or risk becoming a victim.
 


 


Beyond public safety concerns, the commercial real estate market downtown has a high vacancy rate. 
Several office buildings went up for sale this past spring
, following the death of downtown property owner Jim Crockarell in January. His 
Madison Equities
 portfolio includes the First National Bank Building, once a high-status location. The building is now half-empty.
Some of his properties have additional problems. An incensed Mayor Melvin Carter spent time in late August cleaning out parts of the 
Lowry Apartments
, which tenants said was an unsafe and poorly maintained building. Then a Ramsey County district judge 
appointed a receiver to take over management
.
With diminished foot traffic downtown, the restaurant sector has been hit particularly hard. For example, 
Barrio
, in downtown’s Lowertown district, closed in September, and 
Saint Dinette
, located near 
CHS Field
, says it expects to close in 2025.
Accelerating housing conversions
Carter, first elected in 2017, says he recognizes that downtown is at a crossroads, and it needs effective public leadership and substantial private investment to revitalize the city’s core.
 


 


Sitting for an interview in a third-floor conference room at City Hall, Carter characterizes the current situation as “rocky roads underfoot.” But he says there’s a “compelling future out there for downtown St. Paul.” The mayor and the
 Saint Paul Downtown Alliance
, a coalition of business, government, and nonprofit leaders, want more people to live, work, and visit St. Paul.
“We’ve got to be willing to think differently about every single thing,” Carter says.
Roughly 10,000 people live in downtown St. Paul, and a 
Downtown Alliance plan calls for adding 20,000 people over several years
.
“We have a really troublesome vacancy rate with regard to office space,” Carter says. “Our residential buildings are 92% full.” He sees multiple benefits to converting office buildings to housing.
 


 


Carter anticipates that strategy would increase the property tax base and expand the housing supply, and the larger residential population would attract service businesses downtown as well as new employers.
The vacancy rate in St. Paul’s central business district was 26.9% in the second quarter of this year, according to a report from Cushman & Wakefield.
Ward 2 council member Rebecca Noecker, who represents downtown, says that community leaders need to act with a sense of urgency on repurposing office buildings. “Our downtown commercial real estate right now is our biggest opportunity,” she says. Noecker and Chris Hilger, CEO of 
Securian Financial
, are co-chairs of a downtown real estate work group, an effort of the Downtown Alliance.
This fall, 
Gensler
, a global architecture and design firm, will release a report in which it recommends best uses for about 20 downtown St. Paul buildings.

St. Paul City Council disagreement reaches boiling point behind closed doors
 






 


Joe Spencer, president of the Downtown Alliance, contracted with Gensler, which is studying a variety of building characteristics and will provide a detailed analysis for each structure. However, in advance of the study’s release, Spencer cited the 
Park Square Court building
 at 400 N. Sibley St. and the Empire Building at 360 N. Robert St. as good candidates for housing conversion.
Bill Baxley, a Minneapolis-based design principal for Gensler, says his firm gathers data about each building and assesses its conversion potential by looking at five key areas.
The site criteria involve the building’s location and whether it has access to transit, good views, and a walkable area. The building form is assessed to determine whether housing units could be reasonably configured. The size of the “floor plate” is an important factor because it takes into account the distance between windows and the building’s core.
Gensler also looks at the building’s envelope, which involves how much solid wall exists in comparison to window sizes. The last factor that’s scored is for services, which includes parking and the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. Since 2020, Gensler has evaluated more than 1,400 buildings in more than 130 cities.
 


 


“There’s tremendous opportunity to get more housing in the central business district,” Baxley says. While some questioned the financial wisdom of all the Madison Equities properties going on the market at the same time, Baxley says there’s a potential benefit. If multiple properties become housing conversions within the next few years, he says that would have a “dramatic impact right away.”
The floor plates in several downtown St. Paul buildings are smaller than those in office buildings in larger U.S. cities. “Those smaller floor plates, in particular, become an opportunity to convert to housing more effectively,” Carter says, because they allow access to natural light that’s compatible with housing.
Incentives for housing conversions
In the coming months, Noecker expects a variety of steps will be taken to spur conversions.
“One of them is to waive permitting fees,” she says. “We have a million dollars in the mayor’s proposed budget for those fee waivers.” She’s also weighing multiple options for creation of an acquisition fund.
The city of St. Paul will return to the Minnesota Legislature during the 2025 session to seek a special housing tax credit. “We need a financial incentive for these conversions to happen, and we don’t have the cash sitting around in the city’s coffers to do that,” Noecker says.
B Kyle, president and CEO of the 
St. Paul Area Chamber
, is a leader in advocating for the tax credit. During this year’s legislative session, a bill was introduced to facilitate the conversion of underutilized buildings, and eligibility wasn’t limited to St. Paul. The proposed tax credit could equal up to 30% of the costs of conversion.
“The conversion cost is high, as you might imagine,” Kyle says, so the chamber will be working with city leaders and the Downtown Alliance to make the case for the tax credit.
“We have limited Class A office space in downtown St. Paul,” Kyle says. “We have an abundance of Class B and C.” She contends it makes sense to allocate some of the lower-rated space to housing, increase the number of residents living downtown, and ultimately become a more attractive place for businesses to locate.
Tina Hoye, a real estate broker and president of Minneapolis-based 
NTH, Inc.
, has been involved in numerous projects and leases in downtown St. Paul.
“People care about St. Paul and are trying to figure out ways to make it better,” says Hoye, a longtime St. Paul resident and former chair of the St. Paul Area Chamber. “There are a lot of commercial buildings that [already] have been converted to residential,” she says. “I certainly support that continuing, but it’s not a silver bullet, and it’s expensive.”
The city’s rent control ordinance and high interest rates and high construction costs have constrained housing development in St. Paul, she says. She predicts that further building conversions likely will need multiple incentives.
“Look at 
Sherman Associates
,” Hoye says. “They’re doing the Landmark Towers [project] and they got a bunch of tax-increment financing for it because it wasn’t going to pencil out otherwise.” That $97 million project involves building market-rate apartments on St. Peter Street, and the city allocated $12 million in tax-increment financing for it.
Carter says that federal tax credits also should be created for housing conversion, because St. Paul is among many large cities that have been hurt by hybrid and remote work. “I think the federal government is going to have to invest in downtowns around the country,” he says.
 


 


Is downtown safe?
As the CEO of the Minnesota Wild, Matt Majka spends time downtown on days, nights, and weekends. He feels safe.
“I’m frustrated by perception versus reality when it comes to safety,” Majka says. “I don’t begrudge that people have real perceptions that downtowns are unsafe. But as someone who works at an organization that is back to work 100%, my experience has been that the reality is not what I’m hearing the perception is in terms of safety.”
Majka praises St. Paul police officers who patrol downtown, and he thinks the ambassadors employed by the 
Saint Paul Downtown Improvement District
 do a good job keeping the area clean and increasing safety. Commercial property owners on the west side of downtown, including 
Ecolab
, Securian Financial, and 
Travelers
, have been paying special assessments to fund the work of the ambassadors.
They generally work from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and during shifts they are in contact with local police, private security officers, and a safety communications center, according to the Downtown Alliance’s Spencer.
From 2021 through 2023, Spencer says that quality-of-life crimes dropped 40% in the section of downtown covered by the district. He defined those crimes as vandalism, graffiti, and aggressive panhandling. “It’s not violent but makes people uncomfortable,” he says.
That type of behavior rose during the same period in Lowertown, which is not part of the district but will be added beginning Jan. 1. Lowertown is the eastern section of downtown where 
TPT
, Mears Park, and CHS Field are located.

Andy Brehm, a corporate lawyer who lives in St. Paul, argues the city needs to do a better job of reducing all forms of crime, otherwise it will deter more people from visiting downtown. He recalled a recent trip to the 
St. Paul Farmers’ Market
 adjacent to CHS Field. “There were people doing drugs on the street,” Brehm says. “When you have low-level crimes being tolerated, it gives off an impression of lawlessness.”
Not far from the Xcel Energy Center, 
Catholic Charities
 installed a 6-foot-tall fence around Dorothy Day Place, which operates permanent housing and emergency shelters. Catholic Charities put up the fencing after assaults and overdoses occurred near its campus.
Council member Noecker says that downtown St. Paul is on the front lines of the opioid crisis. “We are seeing more and more people overdosing and just walking around in the throes of addiction,” she says. “Our police officers are directed to enforce the law,” she says, but adds that the drug issue presents many challenges.
The St. Paul Fire Department, she says, is beginning a new program in which personnel will carry Suboxone, in addition to Narcan, to respond to addicted people. While Narcan saves lives by reversing an overdose, Suboxone is used to treat opioid addiction. The city of St. Paul is paying for these costs through funding from legal settlements reached by pharmaceutical companies.
The city has received about $4 million so far, which will rise to $14 million by 2038, according to John McCarthy, director of the city’s Office of Financial Services. That money can be used for treatment, prevention, and other strategies.
Expand events and entertainment
Brehm, who also serves as a Republican political analyst, describes the state of downtown St. Paul as “very precarious,” but he emphasizes that city leaders could take two quick steps that would increase the number of people willing to come downtown.
“Make sure there’s zero tolerance when it comes to crimes, including panhandling,” Brehm says. The second step: “The mayor should call St. Paul employees back to the office five days a week.”
In his recent budget address, Carter stressed the importance of city employees working in their city offices, but he didn’t state a required number of office workdays per week.
Carter agrees with Brehm on the importance of getting more people into the downtown area. “We’re doing an incredible job of attracting big events,” Carter says. When he delivered his budget address in August, he mentioned
 the recent Minnesota Yacht Club Music Festival
 and the 2026 World Junior Hockey Championship tournament.
Carter also threw his support behind proposed renovations for Xcel Energy Center, which is closing in on 25 years in operation.
The Minnesota Wild’s parent company manages Xcel Energy Center for hockey games and other entertainment events. “We are fully recovered from Covid in terms of business performance,” Majka says, adding that 2024 has been a strong revenue year. “Concerts and other events that we hold inside Xcel are as good or better than they’ve ever been from an attendance and vibrancy standpoint.”
But he notes that the facility, which is owned by the city of St. Paul, needs upgrades.
“There have been significant public contributions to both 
Target Field
 and 
U.S. Bank Stadium
, so we would like to enjoy that kind of support as well,” Majka says. “But we will absolutely make a significant commitment to the improvement of our campus.” A price and specific plan have not yet been disclosed for a renovated arena.
As public and private leaders consider a vision for the future, the Chamber’s Kyle says they need to avoid thinking small. She recently attended the funeral of popular Mayor George Latimer. “He thought big,” Kyle says. “We can’t limit ourselves. You have to think big enough to inspire the heart of the people.”
She pointed to the 
Osborn370
 building as an example. The former Ecolab tower was turned into a center and creative space for entrepreneurs, she says.
Mayor Carter was born in 1979, which was early in Latimer’s tenure as mayor. Now the spotlight is on Carter to produce for downtown St. Paul. “What stresses me out,” Carter says, “is the thought about how we raise the resources to deliver on this big vision we have for downtown.”

For Katie Wright, the most important part of a settlement with Brooklyn Center over the killing of her son wasn’t the money. It was promises of change and the hope that what happened to 20-year-old Daunte Wright would never happen again. 
But, three years after police officer Kim Potter shot and killed Wright’s son, very little has changed, she said on a summer evening as she sat with Amity Dimock, the mother of Kobe Dimock-Heisler, a 21-year-old who was shot and killed by a Brooklyn Center officer two years earlier. The two women founded the Daunte and Kobe No More Names Initiative, a nonprofit advocating for police reform. 
While the two cases and the consequences for the officers were different – Wright was killed during a traffic stop while Dimock-Heisler, who had autism, was killed in his home during a mental health crisis – both mothers have advocated for changes they say haven’t happened: limiting traffic stops in the city for minor violations and establishing a long-term oversight committee to advise the city and police department on matters about policing.  
 


 


“All they’ve done is prolong,” Wright said. “They’ve done what cities always do – they wait for it to get swept under the rug. People forget. They forget, just like that. Then cities think they can go on, business as usual.” 
“I don’t think (police are) all losers, but people just bootlicking, saying they-can-do-no-wrong, is bullshit,” Dimock added. She was clear she would be blunt when speaking about this topic. 
Both were hopeful when the City Council adopted the 
Daunte Wright and Kobe Dimock-Heisler Community Safety and Violence Prevention Act
 in 2021 and when promises were made as part of a $3.25 million wrongful death lawsuit settlement Wright’s family made with the city in 2022. But now, the mothers and their nonprofit are considering suing the city for not following through on changes in policing.
And in the meantime, Katie Wright fears another mother could lose a child at the hands of police if the city delays or fails to implement changes.
 


 


What’s changed and what hasn’t in three years? 
Looking at the 2021 resolution passed a month after Wright was killed, some parts have been chipped away, others stalled, and some pieces addressed, at least in pilot form. 
This year, specifically, has come with its share of disappointments for Daunte and Kobe’s mothers. In January, the Brooklyn Center City Council shot down an ordinance that would have prohibited traffic stops for minor traffic violations in the city. The vote was 2-3 with only Mayor April Graves and council member Marquita Butler voting for it. 
According to traffic stop data provided by the city, stops have been down by 40% since Daunte Wright’s death. However, a data analysis by the parents’ attorneys shows that at least 49% of those stopped in the past three years were Black, while the city’s population is less than a third Black. In addition, in a quarter of the stops, no race information was recorded, making it more difficult to draw conclusions. But the parents suspect many of those “unknown” cases involved people of color.  Meanwhile, 19.5% of the traffic stops involved white motorists in a city whose population is 38% white.

The settlement agreement required the city to provide bias training through the University of St. Thomas, which the university has confirmed it has completed.  
 


 


However, other pieces of the resolution, which the lawsuit settlement instructed the city to follow through on, have been stalled and sunsetted. A few months ago, the Daunte Wright and Kobe Dimock-Heisler Community Safety and Violence Prevention Implementation Committee, an advisory committee created through the resolution, was sunsetted. The committee was tasked with providing recommendations for policy reforms, but the mothers say the city never implemented the committee’s proposals, pointing back to the traffic stop ordinance that was ultimately shot down. 
Brooklyn Center officials say the committee was never meant to be permanent. While creating a permanent violence prevention committee has been discussed, there is no consensus on what that will look like, what powers it will have or when it will be formed. 
On the flip side, the city did recently take a step toward partnering with community groups to create non-police officer mental health responses to 911 calls, which is a piece of the resolution. This came after the summer conversation with the mothers. 
In September, the council passed a pilot program for mental health response that involves two separate contracts. One contract is with Canopy Roots, a mental health organization offering culturally affirming unarmed first responder services to people in crisis via 911. This organization also serves Minneapolis.

The other contract is with the Hennepin County Human Services and Public Health Department to provide an alternative response for select 911 calls to Brooklyn Center “in a manner that most effectively and efficiently supports and protects the physical, mental, and behavioral health of individuals,” according to the agreement passed by the council at its Sept. 9 meeting. 
During the $750,000 pilot, which is funded through Dec. 31, 2025, officials will collect data and evaluate the possibility of extending the partnership. The city’s general fund is paying for 12% of the program, with the rest funded through grants and supporting funds including grants from Pohlad Collaborative Solutions, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Hennepin County, and American Rescue Plan funds. 
Meanwhile, the City Council has started a review process for the resolution as it stands now. This process would only lead to “minor edits,” mostly to specific verbiage, according to Brooklyn Center Mayor April Graves. But the Daunte and Kobe No More Names Initiative are concerned that this review will lead to continued stalls to tangible reform. 
What officials are saying 
The makeup of both city administration and the Brooklyn Center City Council has shifted quite a bit over the last few years. So has police department leadership. 
 


 


Mayor April Graves was a council member when Daunte Wright was killed. She ran for mayor and won in 2022. Graves said her goal in running was to help unify the city. 
As the Brooklyn Center council reviews the Daunte Wright and Kobe Dimock-Heisler Community Safety and Violence Prevention Act, Graves said she wants to maintain the vision and values of the original resolution while “ensuring council consensus and incorporating staff input during the review process.”

As for sunsetting the implementation committee, Graves said the committee’s work and recommendations had “pretty much wrapped.” Now the council is considering how to define the structure, roles, and authority of the permanent advisory committee to avoid duplication of efforts by other city committees, ensure clarity and maintain continuity in the public safety reform efforts.
“Because of council consensus, sunsetting it made sense so we could think about some other pieces (of the resolution) we have yet to implement,” she said. 
Much of the conversation by city officials about change in the city has revolved around a culture change, the mayor said. Graves noted that the city hired a new human resources and equity director after Daunte Wright was killed. 
“Yes, we’ve moved forward on some things and other things we didn’t necessarily move forward on since then,” she said. “But I think I can honestly say that the council and the staff all care about making sure that everybody in Brooklyn Center feels safe and that we don’t want to ever see anything like that happen again. I think I can honestly say, too, that we’re having difficult conversations and we’re not finished.”
The city has also had multiple police chiefs since Daunte Wright was killed. In the summer, the newest chief for the department, Garett Flesland, started his new role. While he is new to the chief position, Flesland has served on the Brooklyn Center Police Department for 24 years. 
“Big picture, I consider myself a local kid,” Flesland said, who grew up in Brooklyn Park. 
Now, Flesland said his main goal coming into the chief position is to provide stability within the department. When asked about changes on the books, Flesland deferred to the state Legislature or city council. 
Again, the conversation with Flesland mostly revolved around cultural shifts.
“I want to consciously leverage the increased dialogue we as a community have had. If I look at the last three years and compare that to 10 years ago or 15 years ago, I believe there’s so much more communication in general,” the chief said. 
To chief Flesland, Brooklyn Center hasn’t changed as much as people think it has over the last two decades. 
“My entire time here, this has been a diverse community,” he said. “Yes, if we look at and drill down to specific numbers, the percentages have maybe changed a little bit, but we’ve always had a bunch of columns when we’ve looked at who makes up Brooklyn Center.”
However, the numbers show a different story. Those columns have changed significantly. The city was 90% white in 1990, but in 2020 U.S. Census data shows the city of 32,000 is now 38% white, nearly 32% Black and nearly 14% Asian. And 15% of residents listed their ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino. 
Some researchers, including Will Stancil  a fellow at the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity at the University of Minnesota Law School, believe demographics in suburbs like Brooklyn Center have shifted faster than systems like policing. 
““What you get is there’s a disconnect between the police force and the community they are tasked with protecting and serving,” Stancil said, adding that Brooklyn Center has the highest percentage of residents of color in the Twin Cities.
 


 


Again, Chief Flesland was surprised to hear about this large demographic shift that has occurred in his city and within his time with the Brooklyn Center Police Department. It’s easy not to see change when you’re in the place that’s changing, Flesland conceded. While in the span of decades, change can seem slow, it doesn’t mean the shifts aren’t significant. 
State policy around traffic stops
The Daunte and Kobe No More Names Initiative has more work to do, Amity Dimock said. The group’s advocacy work extends beyond Brooklyn Center. This year, Dimock said they will continue to focus on petitioning the state Legislature for statewide traffic stop policy change.  
“(Police) have proven to us that they can’t do low-level traffic stops without being racially biased. And the end result is, unfortunately, Black and brown bodies. We’re just not accepting it,” Dimock said.  
According to Justice Innovation Lab, a national data center led by former prosecutors, policymakers, and community advocates, at least 800 people since 2017 have been killed by law enforcement during interactions that started with a traffic stop. 
Wright was killed during a traffic stop after Potter pulled him over for expired license tags and an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror. Potter claimed she thought she was pulling out her taser instead of her gun when she shot him. In the months that followed, there were calls for the state, cities and counties to end “pretext stops,” or stops for minor violations that police hope will lead to evidence of other crimes. 
These stops often disproportionately impact Black drivers, including in Minneapolis, where the U.S. Justice Department found that Black individuals were 6.5 times more likely to be stopped by Minneapolis police officers. Based on the Justice Department’s analysis of traffic stop data in Brooklyn Center, the suburb’s disparity is about the same. 
Lawmakers at the State Capitol have introduced legislation multiple times over the last few sessions that would limit pretext stops statewide, but their efforts to get the bill passed have been unsuccessful so far. 
Meanwhile, efforts by smaller governments have proved effective. Ramsey County, for example, limited non-public safety related traffic stops after finding that Black drivers were disproportionately stopped by police. Two years later, an analysis of the policy showed a decrease in racial disparities related to traffic stops while having no discernible impact on public safety. 
Kim Potter and who teaches police moving forward  
Kim Potter was sentenced to two years in prison after she was convicted of manslaughter for the killing of Daunte Wright. She was released from prison after 16 months. 
Recently, Potter made headlines again. Last month, Potter was slated to speak at a Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Oversight Agency training titled: “Remorse to Redemption: Lessons Learned.” This  came about after Potter met with Imran Ali, the prosecutor who charged her case, proposing using her case as a teaching opportunity to teach officers what not to do. However, after The Seattle Times reported about her upcoming speaking engagement, the hosting agency’s leadership canceled the training. 
While the Seattle event was canceled, The 
Associated Press reported
 last week that Potter and Ali have delivered presentations at Minnesota Sheriff’s Association events in June and September. They also presented at a law enforcement conference in Indiana in May. 
The decision to bring Potter in to speak was made by “well-meaning” officers in the Seattle agency’s leadership “who were looking to learn from someone’s mistakes,” the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Oversight Agency’s board chair David Postman, 
told the New York Times.
“But this decision was made without the conversation that needs to happen around issues like this,” Postman said after he was part of rescinding the invitation. 
This incident has sparked debate over whether or not a former police officer who was sentenced for shooting and killing a Black man should be training officers. In the same New York Times article, Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, called the cancellation of Potter’s talk “a missed opportunity.”
But Katie Wright called the speaking engagements “a slap in the face.” 
For the trip to Washington, Potter’s flight and hotel would have been paid for, and she would have received a small stipend. Imagine being a mother who sees her son’s killer profit off of her part in that story, Wright said. 
“Nobody until the day that I die will be able to profit off of our tragedy,” Wright said. “That’s not OK. Why would you want to do that? And people are saying she’s trying to right her wrongs. Well, she can’t do that. The only way that she could ever right her wrongs ever again in her life is if she could give me my son back.” 
If officers want to learn why it’s important not to use deadly force, Wright said she or other family members of loved ones killed by police could speak to that.

The memorial
On a Thursday evening, Katie Wright and Amity Dimock sat in front of the Daunte Wright memorial at the intersection of 63rd Avenue North and Katherine Drive in Brooklyn Center.
At one point, Dimock started singing “I Want to Hold Your Hand” by the Beatles. Grasping Wright’s hand, Amity and Wright joked that they’ve been hanging out too much over the last few years. They’ve grown close, sharing a common goal. 
It was a cool day. Flowers were planted in the spot where Daunte Wright died after attempting to flee from Potter after she shot him. An offering bowl was placed in front of his memorial. It’s imprinted with the folds of the clothes he was wearing the day he was killed. Wright traced the crevices in the bowl with her fingertips. She pointed to the utility pole across the street. It was adorned with air fresheners, all depicting messages for Wright: “I love you,” “I miss you” and “Justice for Daunte.”

This memorial was also part of the Wright families’ settlement agreement. But, at the time, the city still needed to change Daunte’s cause of death written on a memorial plaque. It was listed on Daunte Wright’s death certificate that his cause of death was a “gunshot wound to the chest.” The death certificate also said “homicide.” His family said the plaque also should say “homicide.”
“Verbiage and language is super important, especially to a city that has caused such harmful things to communities,” Wright said. “The death certificate, even though it says homicide, that doesn’t necessarily mean murder, right? If you’re killed by somebody else, it’s still considered a homicide, which is super important.”
Update: This story has been updated to reflect that the Potter and Ali presented at a conference in Indiana not Iowa.

In the same month Minneapolis faced continued scrutiny over its response to city homeless encampments, Hennepin County was recognized for its preemptive response to challenges people face before they become unhoused 
in a documentary by national nonprofit Invisible People. 
Nationally, the rate of unsheltered homelessness is about 1 in 1,300 people, according to David Hewitt, Hennepin County manager for housing security. In Hennepin County, however, the rate of homelessness is about 1 in 2,700 people, less than half the national average. This was one of the major data points recognized in the documentary titled “America Can End Homelessness: Hennepin County Proved It’s Possible” posted to YouTube by Invisible people on Sept. 27. 
Meanwhile, the conversation happening within the city of Minneapolis 
is very different
. In December, the Minneapolis City Council passed an ordinance 
declaring unsheltered homelessness a public health emergency.
 Since then, council members have continued to cite rises in the number of unhoused individuals sleeping outside. For example, during a Sept. 19 meeting, council Vice President Aisha Chughtai, who chairs the budget and finance committee, said there has been about a 17% increase in homelessness in Minneapolis since this time last year. 
 


 


At the same meeting, members passed three major ordinances addressing housing and homelessness:
 a $1.5 million grant for Agate Housing,
 an ordinance requiring increased data on the impacts of the encampment evictions and responses, and an ordinance that increases pre-eviction filing notices from 14 days to 30 days. 
Tackling the problem of homelessness and reducing the number of people sleeping outside is a multifaceted issue with many cogs turning at various levels of governance, philanthropy and public/private partnerships. 
For Minneapolis, here’s a quick look at who’s working on what between the city, county, nonprofits and the private sector to tackle this issue:
The numbers in context
Each January, Hennepin County conducts an annual count of individuals identified to be sleeping outside as part of a federally mandated count conducted in every community across the country. This count has been happening every year since 2005. 
 


 


January 2020: Before the pandemic, Hennepin County counted 642 people sleeping outside


2021: No count was conducted because of the pandemic


2022: 487 people sleeping outside


2023: 469 people sleeping outside


2024: 496 people sleeping outside
So, while the overall count has increased over the last three years, it has technically decreased since prior to the pandemic, though Hewitt noted that this count only represents a snapshot and not breadth of this number throughout the year. 
“And to be clear, I don’t think it means there isn’t a crisis,” Hewitt said. “I think a single person sleeping outside is a crisis. One person outside is one too many.”
The role of the county
County officials and community workers have prioritized working on prevention through early intervention.

Unique compared to most areas across the country, Hennepin County invested almost 40% of its pandemic recovery funds into homelessness and housing, Hewitt said. 
 


 


“And those were discretionary funds that could have gone to any county function, but this is where we felt we could have the most beneficial impact for our community, both immediate and long term,” Hewitt said.  
The documentary by Invisible People focuses on how these investments impacted outcomes for unhoused people in the area. 
What do those outcomes look like? Well, the number of people exiting homelessness to permanent housing has actually increased by 57%. The county’s Homeless to Housing team, a team of 58 county staffers, has housed 917 people since November 2021 with a 94% retention rate. And that’s just through that team’s efforts. Last year, 2,171 individuals, including those helped by the county team, moved directly from unsheltered or sheltered settings into permanent housing.
The goal of the county’s approach has been to prevent evictions. In the 2024 funding round, the county awarded $17 million to create or preserve 1,500 units of affordable housing, with 40% of those units affordable to people with incomes at 30% or less of the area median income. Through this and other initiatives, the county provided emergency rental assistance to more than 2,000 households, with fewer than 2% of those households entering homelessness.
 


 


While Hewitt emphasized, again, that anyone living outside is a crisis, he said it is true that the area has seen significant improvements. 
It’s easy to forget how things have changed since the pandemic, he noted. For example, in 2020, there was an encampment in Powderhorn Park with over 600 tents, and another encampment on the Greenway with over 100 tents, Hewitt noted. Currently, the total number of tents across all encampments is around 150-200, which is lower than the 2020 levels.
The county is facing a $30 million gap in its proposed 2025 human services budget to sustain the expanded shelter, case management, and other homelessness services funded by pandemic relief dollars.
The role of the city 
The role of the city when addressing homelessness is quite front-facing. Specifically, the city is charged with the dispersal of encampments. 
 


 


Enrique Velasquez, director of regulatory services for Minneapolis, oversees the city’s homeless response unit. The city’s approach to addressing homelessness involves community reporting of encampments, which are then evaluated based on property type and location, he said. The process works differently depending on if an encampment is on land owned by the city, a private company or individual, or other entities like the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT).

The process to disperse encampments involves multiple departments, including the police, he noted. 
 


 


This unit also works closely with the county, nonprofits and the private sector to find housing and funding to address a growing need for affordable housing, Velasquez said. 
“It takes every sector, public sector, private sector, nonprofit, NGOs, it’s gonna take all of us to find a sustainable solution,” he said. 
The role of nonprofits 
The city recently passed a $1.5 million grant to Agate Housing’s shelter and transitional home, a 137-bed shelter at 510 S. 8th St. This was matched, per the requirement that the grant be unlocked, by an anonymous donor. However, 
there was contention over if it was appropriate to reallocate funds the way the council did to make this possible. 
But this is an example of the nonprofit sector’s role in helping address homelessness. It’s also an example of the challenge facing many nonprofits across the state and country as leaders say they’re facing limited resources available to compensate for rising demand for services.  
The pandemic and its aftermath have posed a heightened challenge for shelters across the Twin Cities, Virginia Brown, vice president of external relations for the nonprofit organization, told MinnPost last week. Not only has there been a struggle to maintain funding streams, more people are becoming unhoused and straining the region’s existing resources. And infrastructure is aging, as is the case for the 510 Agate building.

Since the pandemic, other shelters have come online to help provide resources and low-barrier housing to people. This includes Avivo Village, a 100-unit tiny dwelling shelter and one of the county’s lowest barrier shelters. In Avivo’s case, this means people can come and go as they please. There’s no curfew. 
A key to the success of places like Avivo is access to resources to find permanent housing. In its recent push to focus on moving people into permanent housing, the county identified that it needed to double down on providing case management where people needed it most within the community. Case managers work to get people out of shelters or out of outdoor encampment and into permanent housing. 
The county doubled down with nonprofit partners to build out case management capacity but also built out its own team to go into shelters, encampments and other outdoor unhoused settings to help house people. 
This didn’t really exist before the pandemic, Hewitt said, noting one shelter program had a 1 to 80 case management ratio. Now, 75% or shelters are open 24/7 so people can stay during the day to work with case managers. 
The role of for-profits
Public-private partnerships happen most noticeably in development of affordable and deeply affordable housing, especially as housing costs rise drastically across the nation. 
There are also cases where private support networks partner with governing bodies to provide joint funding to nonprofit projects. For example, Catholic Charities Endeavors, a supportive housing program that began in 2019 and opened in 2022, rehabbed a nursing home 
through a unique public, private partnership with Hennepin County. 
This location specifically provides respite care for people recovering from surgery with nurses on site to assist them.
The project was only possible through a total of $75 million in investments from public and private entities including public investments from Hennepin County, Minnesota Housing Finance Agency and the City of Minneapolis and Minneapolis Public Housing Authority; and private investments from donors like the Richard M. Schulze Family Foundation and Mary and Gene Frey, as well as the pro bono development by Dominium. Sunrise Banks and U.S. Bank also contributed new market tax credits for the project.

As reliance on clean energy grows, and the industry continues its exponential expansion amid worsening climate conditions, two groups are making sure underserved communities aren’t left behind.
Minneapolis Climate Action (MCA), along with Renewable Energy Partners, allied to help establish the Regional Apprenticeship Training Center, located in the heart of a north Minneapolis neighborhood. By providing clean energy workforce training and a space to do it in that’s along one of the busiest bus routes in the state on Plymouth Avenue, the groups aim to equitably facilitate the community’s transition to renewable energy.
“It’s meant to be an establishment to enable people in the neighborhood, people that are from disenfranchised communities, to come in and be trained in clean energy industries – industries that we have been left out of, historically,” said Akisha Everett, MCA’s executive director. 
 


 


MCA is new to north Minneapolis but has existed since 2007 as part of a group called Linden Hills Power of Light, a community group that organized action around recycling and carbon reduction. Now, MCA is led by Everett, who came over from the University of Minnesota’s Institute on the Environment during a pilot program to install battery modules to make the solar power at the training center self-sustainable.
Everett, a Black woman and north Minneapolis resident, said working with Renewable Energy Partners and its founder, Jamez Staples, felt impactful, prompting her to leave her position at the University and join the effort happening in her neighborhood.

“I knew I needed to be back here to help with this energy transition for this demographic of people (and) to help open some doors and be a person who looks like my community,” she said. “If people don’t have the information, they  never tap into the training or education needed to pursue this career pathway.”

Everett said MCA is taking a two-pronged approach to promoting usage of clean energy and making it more accessible to underserved communities. 
 


 


The first arm is through the installation of community solar gardens that MCA and Renewable Energy Partners have helped establish – one at the EMERGE recycling center in southeast Minneapolis and another at Minneapolis North Community High School. The solar gardens prioritize low and moderate income groups, helping them to become subscribers to renewable energy while getting discounted prices on their energy bills, which Everett called a win-win as climate change worsens. 
“People can feel like they are doing their part as we’re trying to come around this curve of energy transition, and we’re coming around this curve whether we want to or not,” she said. “We can see it just based on the sporadic weather conditions – hurricanes, flooding, and all this stuff.”
 


 


The second part of this approach is through clean energy workforce development. Among the training offered to community members free of charge are a 12-week solar installation course, a building science course that teaches how to make homes more energy efficient, an HVAC lab and an introduction to energy efficient construction methods. The building also features a K-12 STEM activities program that teaches kids about robotics, drone operation and 3D printing, among other activities.
Shubha Harris, equitable energy policy consultant for Fresh Energy, a Minnesota-based nonprofit that aims to accelerate the state’s transition to clean energy, said the accessibility of the training center to north Minneapolis residents is important to facilitating their transition to clean energy.
 


 


“A lot of that work needs to be done locally, because we have to upgrade apartment buildings and single family homes in every community,” Harris said. “Having workers that can do that work in their own communities benefits those workers and benefits the community simultaneously.”

In recent years, the Minnesota Legislature has ramped up efforts to limit carbon emissions and speed up the state’s transition to clean energy. 
A historic energy budget package passed in 2023
 includes a new law requiring residents across the state to only use carbon-free electricity sources by 2040, along with nearly $250 million that funded the creation of more clean energy jobs, reduction of energy costs and further efforts to mitigate climate change. 
As governments and companies continue to invest trillions into renewable energy, Harris said the industry represents the greatest economic opportunity in decades. And since the industry is still relatively new, it also presents an opportunity to avoid exacerbating disparities that exist in established industries through investment in underserved communities, she said. 
“We have the opportunity to maybe close the gap a little if we can funnel the money more equitably and more broadly, so that the funding doesn’t go to the people that are already established and already successful in this workforce,” she said. “The clean energy transition is gaining steam, and ensuring that diverse communities and businesses from people from diverse backgrounds can benefit from the money that’s coming from federal and state governments will help to ensure those businesses benefit and their communities benefit.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is excited about the idea of using bubbles to quell downtown violence.
Yes, bubbles.
Frey shared the potential strategy during a weekend panel at MinnPost Festival. 
 


 


“Apparently, if you’ve got a whole bunch of people that are looking to cause trouble – if you put bubbles out there, it’s really hard to look tough when you’ve got bubbles floating around,” Frey said.
Axios Twin Cities reporter Nick Halter, who moderated the Saturday panel, followed up, asking Frey: “We’re talking about (bubbles), like at a kid’s birthday?” 
“Yeah. You think I’m joking. I’m actually not,” Frey responded. “It’s a bubble machine – and the people who are looking to cause trouble are like, ‘I can’t look tough around these bubbles.’ So they disperse and it deescalates the situation and people who aren’t looking to cause trouble love bubbles.” 
Frey said he’d heard from his staff about a new public safety strategy on his drive over to the event held at Westminster Presbyterian Church, calling the bubble tactic “very premature… But obviously I thought it was pretty innovative.”

Using bubbles is not an official Minneapolis Police Department strategy, MPD officials clarified this week. However, some downtown businesses do use bubbles in parking lots to deter crime, according to the mayor’s office spokesperson Ally Peters. For example, they are deployed at the 414 Hennepin parking lot and outside the Brass Rail Lounge, also on Hennepin downtown.  
Similar in concept to bubbles, Twin Cities businesses have tried using classical music to deter crime, including in 2006 at 
Gameworks on Block E
 and, more recently, at 
Midway Marketplace in St. Paul
.

So, while dispersing bubbles may not be a standard tactic in crime prevention, it isn’t an unheard of tool. And there is a reason why seeking new methods to deescalate violence has been on the mayor’s mind. Prior to a few weeks back, the city had seen a significant reduction in crime across the board, including downtown, Frey said, crediting the city’s late night downtown safety plan and a push to get record numbers of guns off the streets. But, “these last couple weeks were bad,” he said. 
Over the last few weeks, violence has returned and escalated twice at one of the city’s hotspots for fights. On
 Sept. 14
 and
 Sept. 21
, three people were killed – ages 16, 20 and 21– and many more injured as conflicts escalated at the corner of Hennepin Avenue and Fifth Street .
 


 


This area has long been a scene for fights, often among teenagers. Over the last five years or so, those getting into fights, having guns and committing other crimes like carjackings have been younger and younger, Frey said. 
“There’ll be a beef or a fight between somebody – that starts oftentimes online, sometimes it’s about a girl – and they’ll get in an argument and it leads to: ‘I’ll see you at 11 p.m. at Fifth and Hennepin,” he said.  
MPD has been working to address the downtown violence, with a focus on teens, but bubbles have not been a recent talking point within MPD, Sgt. Garrett Parten said. Instead, MPD increased officer presence over the weekend. The department also has deployed a unit designated to interact with teens prior to the downtown curfew. Youth under the age of 12 must be out of downtown and home before 10 p.m., under the age of 14 by 11 p.m. and ages 15-17, by midnight. 
“When you talk to a private company (using bubbles), this was in addition to several other efforts they had, including added security, using gates, towing vehicles, things like that,” Parten said. “So it’s hard to know how much effect bubbles actually had because it’s just one part of a concerted effort.”

Axios Twin Cities reporter Nick Halter spoke with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey at Saturday’s MinnPost Festival. Here are the highlights of that conversation:
(Note: This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.)
Halter:
 People are back downtown in a lot of ways, but it is mostly visitors so far. We’re not seeing the full rebound for workers coming back. What is your administration doing to speed up this idea of turning some of these office buildings into apartments? 
 


 


Frey:
 We are seeing record numbers of visitors come downtown. Last year, we saw a 45% increase in the number of people that were coming downtown to go to a ball game and watch a concert (and) go to the theaters. That actually put us at No. 1 one in terms of the rebound in the entire country of any major city out there. At the same time, we do not see the same numbers that we saw pre-COVID. And a whole lot (of it) is this remote work concept. It was probably inevitable. People were going to figure out that Zoom and (Microsoft Teams) was a thing, but it got expedited in about five to eight years by COVID-19, so cities around the country are having to react a whole lot faster.
We’re trying to convert as many of these buildings as we possibly can now. Notably, it’s not easy to convert every building. The glass, sleek skyscrapers just don’t work well for the transition. Where it does work is some of these older, often pre-World War II buildings. (In these buildings) the floor plate can be transitioned to units both market rate and affordable. So the city is doubling down on making sure that those units are transitioned. One, through subsidy. Two, we just passed an ordinance that streamlines the process, eliminates bureaucratic red tape to allow owners and developers that are looking to make this shift faster and easier.
The struggle here (is that it) is really expensive to do this. I talk to developers who say it’s as much as double the cost of new construction to turn an old building into apartments. You could just build a new apartment building for half the cost. It’s worth questioning how many of these buildings are worth preserving. Perhaps we need to talk about tearing some of them down. 
Not every building is going to be able to transition. And in some cases, we should be thinking about what’s next for how downtown is used, and that may be creating a one block park, rather than having a building that is vacant. Yes, we are going to have to shift how we’re collecting taxes as a whole. And, yes, we’re going to need additional subsidies, too, because some buildings are ripe for that transition. 
 


 


We’re hoping to get (a bill that would provide subsidies for transition) passed next session. It was going to be passed last session, and I’m confident there will be additional subsidies that will incentivize owners and developers to make that transition.
Halter: 
These office towers were paying huge amounts of taxes. The development happening here was adding to the tax base, and homeowners were shielded from a lot of the big property taxes you saw after the Great Recession. That is going to change this fall. It’s going to be a while before we start seeing the conversions (and) until we start seeing the office market pick up again. How are we going to deal with budget issues and is it sustainable to keep this level of property taxes going that we’re going to see this coming year?
Frey: 
It’s not sustainable for the long haul. We’re going to need to make some significant changes. 
There has been a massive change in how property taxes are collected around the country. It’s not just Minneapolis, St Paul’s exactly the same. Virtually, in terms of property and tax increases, the suburbs are even higher. A few of these buildings downtown, they previously generated about as much property tax revenue as some other wards in their entirety. When that building sells for 40 cents on the dollar because occupancy has dropped, because people are working remotely, the tax revenue still needs to be collected. (The revenue burden) just shifts, and the people who pay for it (are) homeowners, renters.

We gotta find efficiencies in the city. There is no free money, and we have to be smart with what we’re doing with our tax dollars, and we’ve got to find a mechanism for collecting taxes that (isn’t) totally regressive. Property taxes disproportionately impact low-iincome people and seniors. There are many different collection nodes at the state, including local government aid that we haven’t gotten since the Pawlenty administration in significant form. We are going to the state this year to see what the additional sources that we can access (are). We’re going to find where to find efficiencies through vacancies at the city, and we’re also going to be looking at what other forms of revenue we’re going to be able to get.

Halter: 
Two violent incidents with deaths have happened at Fifth and Hennepin in the last couple of weekends. You told me before we got here (about) one of the tactics you’re using is bubbles. Can you explain what you’re talking about? 
Frey: 
I literally just heard this on my way over here. And so this is not like a well-scripted proposal by any stretch. 
Prior to a couple of weeks ago, things were actually going significantly better. We had seen major drops of crime. We had a late night downtown safety plan that has been functioning extraordinarily well. We’ve been getting guns off the street in record numbers, which is wonderful and a great testament to the job that our police officers are doing, but getting record guns off the street means that there are record numbers of guns out on the street. So we are having to act as quickly and strategically as possible. 
 


 


We’ve been trying a number of different tactics. One of them that I just heard on my way over here was a great tool to de-escalate is bubbles. I haven’t seen this yet, so I was going to get a video of how they do it tonight, but apparently, if you got a whole bunch of people that are looking to cause trouble, if you put bubbles out there, it’s really hard to look tough with bubbles floating around. People that are looking to cause trouble decide “I can’t look tough and be around these bubbles,” so they disperse and it deescalates the situation. The people who aren’t looking to cause trouble love bubbles. This is a little premature, but I thought it was a pretty innovative deal.
Halter: 
One of the storefront working group’s ideas was to flip them all, close Nicollet Mall to buses, allow open containers, potentially. But it could take Metro Transit two more years to get to the point where they close it to buses. Can we speed this up?
Frey:
 I think we could have a pedestrian equip. There’s some changes that we need to make in order to get there. Look, we’ve already got two largely bus-specific streets just next to Nicollet Mall in Marquette, Second. They were designed to handle bus traffic. This is not a massive, unbelievable shift that is insurmountable. We can have the buses go down, mark two, open Nicolet to pedestrians. 
Just making Nicollet Mall pedestrian doesn’t make it a great pedestrian mall. You got to have people. If it’s too long of a pedestrian space and it doesn’t have the necessary density of people, you’re never going to get the necessary density of the shops that you want to see. Part of this whole deal is a transformation of downtown, where you got more residents there, you got more tourists and people looking to have a great time coming in. And then you’ve got more small local businesses that follow. If you look at East Hennepin, by way of example, or you look at North Loop, both are bumping with businesses. There’s barely a vacancy out there, and it’s because there’s a density of people, and that’s what we need to bring to Nicollet Mall as well to allow it to be pedestrian.
 


 


Halter:
 Uptown, particularly Hennepin and Lake, is a ghost town. What will it take to turn it around?
Frey:
 Uptown has been hit hard. There needs to be renewed focus on it, and we need to be watching out for these small local business owners who have the courage to say, “I’m putting down roots here.” We should be supporting them with our foot traffic and with our pocketbooks. And so there’s a few things that we’re working on to get things going again.
 


 


One, construction will end. It’s a pain, I get it. In defense of anybody who’s doing this work, it’s not just about the surface level of the street. It’s the guts of the street. You got old pipes that need to be fixed, otherwise you don’t get water. You got old electrical that needs to be secured, otherwise you have all sorts of flammable issues. It’s necessary. It’s going to be beautiful once it’s done. And we need to be doubling down investments. One example of where we’re investing is in our vacant storefronts initiative. Rather than just have a vacant storefront, we at the city are stepping up to help subsidize a plan to get local artists in there. Local artists get to set up their shop. It’s something that livens up the street. it makes you want to be on the street because it’s no longer vacant. We’re going to be setting this up and really targeting Uptown specifically and targeting specific support to those small and local businesses in the form of technical assistance so that we can make sure that new entrepreneurs can stay. 
One of the most popular things to do is to say “Uptown is dead.” They were saying that in 2018, they were saying that in 2015, and they were saying that in 2012. What is true is that Uptown is changing and Uptown, I think, will always be in a state of evolution. That’s just how that neighborhood works. This is a more difficult stage of that evolution, but it will get better.
Halter: 
Can you speak to corporate leadership’s role in accelerating downtown core redevelopment?
Frey: 
First off, we have a very philanthropic business community here, and I think the trick is not getting them to do philanthropy, the trick is getting them to target their philanthropy towards low- income people. If you look at big dollar gifts – not just in Minnesota, but nationwide – a huge percentage of those huge dollar gifts go to art and universities. We’re all for art and universities. It’s also really important to give money to poor people, and by that I mean organizations that help out low-income people, whether that’s through deeply affordable housing or shelter space.
The second thing is getting them to bring their people back downtown. I remember I had a series of meetings with a number of corporate business leaders downtown, and I said to them, “Alright, what do you need? What do you need me to do in order to bring your people back downtown?” This was in 2022, and what we heard most often was safety. We needed to be safe. We want you to put some beat officers out there, if you can, police officers in the area and/ or violence interrupters. 
We increased the presence, and we made sure that there were beat officers out there. We found ways, through really strategic plans, to drive down crime. About three quarters of a year after we had proven ourselves, I went back to those same leaders, and I said, “OK, we did our part – now you do yours.” 
What I heard most often was, “Yeah, safety was and is an issue, but the main issue is that we have too many employees that don’t want to come back. Now, what we’re finding is that both business owners and employees are recognizing the value of doing this in-person work. In my office, we come in five days a week. We’re extremely flexible. If anybody needs to leave for basically any reason, I don’t think I’ve ever said no. 
A few years ago somebody said to me, “Mayor, you’re behind the times. The new thing is that we all work from home.” 
And I said, “No, you’re behind the times. In 10 years, in 15 years, somebody is going to have this great idea where office culture improves. If people have the ability to look each other in the eye and have a conversation, you’re more likely to get promoted if/when a difficult situation or a crisis hits, your boss sees you and you’re willing to step up to do the difficult thing.”
I think more and more of these corporate leaders need to be making that jump. Many of them are. There is a consistent trend of where we’re about 70% coming in in some form, that’s up from 50% and 60%. I think that we’re going to get back up to somewhere around 80% to 85%, but we’re not going to get back to 100%.  I’m in the reality business as mayor, and the reality is we’re not going to get back to 100. There’s going to be a chunk of that space that just needs to change, and we’re going to change with it. 
Halter:
 But how do you run a skyway lunch shop when you have three days of business, how do you pay those taxes? How do you pay the rent when you’re really down to three days? Ideally, you’d have residents who came down for dinner, and you’d be like, more of a real 24/7 (business), but we’re so far from that. 
Frey: 
You’re not wrong. So Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, we’re seeing downtown pretty well (populated). The line at the salad place is out the door. I’ll acknowledge that Mondays and Fridays are slow, and there’s going to be a shift. It’s already taken place, not all of the skyway locations that we had pre-COVID are still there.
One of the things that we’re looking at doing is just something different than what people are used to. It’s not going to be the cities that are clinging white knuckle to what once was that are ultimately successful. It’s going to be the ones that are making the shift. 
When it’s super cold and I’m looking for something fun to do with Frida, we drive to Edina to an indoor playground that they have in Edinborough. We could have that in the skyway. You could set up a scenario where you’ve got a playground, you’ve got places to eat for the parents to sit, maybe have a drink, pretend like they’re watching their kid, while their kid is having an absolute ball, and the parents are talking to their friends. It’s safe. It’s indoors, where you want to utilize some space. People pay money to go to Edinborough, and it works. There are some areas where we are right now looking to target an indoor playground. You’ll see me there. You’ll see Frida there, for sure. You’ll see a ton of other parents there as well.
There will be parking (for these playgrounds). I mean sometimes this stuff happens on the weekend. And so what we’re looking to facilitate is, yes, some form of reduced parking is also a possibility, and so there are some options as to how we can do that. 
Editor’s note: Special thanks to Axios Twin Cities’ Kyle Stokes for logistical support in recording this conversation.

Minneapolis City Council members are at odds with city staff and Mayor Jacob Frey over a decision to allocate city money to a grant for a downtown shelter and transitional home and how it could ultimately impact city projects and staffing. 
On Wednesday, a downtown Agate Housing shelter and transitional home received an anonymous $1.5 million match donation that unlocked a $1.5 million grant to keep Agate’s 
137-bed shelter at 510 S. 8th St. from closing permanently.
 The match came less than a week after the council approved the grant, which pulls funds from city departments that have had surplus budgets for at least five years. Passage was not unanimous; councilors Linea Palmisano, Michael Rainville and LaTrisha Vetaw voted no because of concerns over process and where the money would come from. 
City staffers are warning the council that such budget decisions have potential consequences.

Saray Garnett-Hochuli, deputy city operations officer, sent the council an email Wednesday about the “anticipated consequences” of the grant approval being based on a second quarter report projection rather than the year-end budget. A budget surplus is not recognized until books are closed at year end and all revenues and expenses are recognized, she said. 
“There was no discussion with the Office of Public Service as to the impacts this would have on our departments,” she wrote. 
Most notably, funding for the $35 million
 North Commons Park rebuild
 will be cut by approximately $350,000, which Garnett-Hochuli says will have multiple impacts on the project.
On Wednesday, a downtown Agate Housing shelter and transitional home received an anonymous $1.5 million match donation that unlocked a $1.5 million grant to keep Agate’s 137-bed shelter at 510 S. 8th St. from closing permanently.

In response to claims by city staff and Frey that the decision was based on premature budget data, councilors brought forward a legislative directive to investigate city “financial discrepancies.” 
 


 


 


 


“Following this decision, the Mayor announced that the savings data was inaccurate, calling into question his own Administration’s financial reporting, and provided a list of arbitrary budget cuts he plans to institute in retaliation. The cuts were announced in an informal, matter-of-fact email to Council Members yesterday afternoon,” reads a joint email by council vice president Aisha Chughtai and council member Emily Koski. 
This all came out before a 4 p.m. deadline for Frey to decide whether  he would veto the grant. Ultimately, he decided to neither sign nor veto the legislative file, letting it pass his 4 p.m. Thursday deadline, which means the grant ultimately passed. 
This was also how a council-lead change to how the Minneapolis police contract would be funded passed in July. 
In a Thursday letter to the City Council, Frey scolded the governing body, saying councilors did not consult city experts before making a decision that could impact city budgets. He called the intent of the grant “commendable” but said the funding decision “lacked proper vetting and was based on point-in-time budget projections, which is completely irresponsible.”
As an  alternative to cutting money from North Commons, the city could lay off staff, he said in his letter. He also said surplus dollars are often used to offset tax increases in future budget cycles.
 


 


Ultimately, the mayor implied that councilors’ distrust of him had bled into work the body should be doing in conjunction with city staff. 
“We have financial experts at the city, and they are not the mayor, and they are not the council … we need to stop pretending like we are the experts at the expense of those who actually are,” Frey wrote. “It causes problems not just for this body or administration, but for every administration and council to come, every city staff member to come, and every resident of Minneapolis.”

A homeless shelter that provides critical services in downtown Minneapolis is in dire need of repairs, and its future may be determined by city politics.
Regardless of what happens at City Hall, Agate Housing’s 137-bed shelter at 510 S. 8th St. will close at least temporarily on Oct. 9. That’s a significant blow for Minneapolis, which has declared unsheltered homelessness a public health emergency and continues to see higher numbers of unhoused individuals. Meanwhile, shelters across the region have faced limited resources available to compensate for rising demand for services. 
With the transitional housing facility’s fate hanging in the balance, on Sept. 19 the City Council passed a resolution that would reappropriate money from multiple city department surpluses to fund a $1.5 million grant. Contingent to the grant, Agate must secure at least an additional $1.5 million match, which the organization’s leaders say is more than attainable.
 


 


Passage of the resolution was not unanimous: council members Linea Palmisano, Michael Rainville and LaTrisha Vetaw voted no because of concerns over process and where the money would come from. The naysaying council members said they had concerns about where the funding for the Agate grant was coming from. Council members spearheading the resolution said the money would only come from departments that have had a budget surplus for at least five years. 
It also remains unclear if Mayor Jacob Frey will sign, veto or let the resolution pass without doing either. He has until 4 p.m. Thursday to decide. 
Frey’s administration sent the following statement in the interim as the mayor debates his decision: “Mayor Frey is supportive of the important work of shelters. The City Council did no vetting of the source of funding before passage and it’s resulting in significant problems. The mayor will spend the next day reviewing the appropriation with City staff and subject matter experts before making a decision.”

‘An important asset’
 
Even if it receives the city’s grant, Agate needs a thorough assessment to know the extent of renovation needed, said Virginia Brown, vice president of external relations for the nonprofit organization. 
 


 


The 100-year-old building includes a 42-bed shelter and 95-bed “low barrier” housing area. An initial assessment by a construction company conducted about a year ago found the building needed between $3 million and $5 million in renovations.
“What we’ll need to do now is get a more specific number… So that’s our next step, to make sure we understand exactly what the full need is and what else we’ll need to raise, in addition to the city’s match, to actually have the building in working condition and providing a safe and dignified home,” Brown said. “There’s a little bit to be determined about whether or not we can actually reopen, but we’re really optimistic, and the city funds are excellent momentum to show that they are identifying this as an important asset. They will hopefully be a leader and others will follow to support.”
Whether or not the price tag ends up closer to $5 million will determine how much more Agate has to raise outside of the match stipulated in the city grant. If the nonprofit can move forward with renovations, Brown said it would likely take 6 to 12 months for the facility to reopen. 
The pandemic and its aftermath have posed a heightened challenge for shelters across the Twin Cities, Brown noted. Not only has there been a struggle to maintain funding streams, more people are becoming unhoused and straining the region’s existing resources. 
 


 


 


 


“The cost of providing services have increased while the funding we might have through various government agencies has not increased, so more and more philanthropy has had to close the gap in order to actually provide all the services,” Brown said. “That’s a whole effort in and of itself and possibly not a winning effort for everyone. There’s only so much philanthropy to go around, and it certainly benefits the bigger organizations with bigger names.” 
Brown also wanted to clarify an inaccuracy that was brought up during the Thursday, Sept. 19 meeting when the resolution passed. Council member Palmisano said during the meeting that the 510 building is not part of Hennepin County’s coordinated entry system, which helps refer unhoused people to various shelters. She said reopening the Agate’s 510 in the future would not help reduce the number of unhoused people sleeping outside. 
Brown said that, though the 510 program does not use coordinated entry, this does not mean that it does not serve unhoused populations sleeping outside. The 510 building and board and lodge program takes referrals from various sources and those referrals include people who are living in encampments. 
Disagreement over process, again
At the Sept. 19 meeting, council Vice President Aisha Chughtai, who chairs the budget and finance committee, said there has been about a 17% increase in homelessness in Minneapolis in the Twin Cities metro since this time last year. This was also reflected in December when Minneapolis declared unsheltered homelessness a public health emergency. 
 


 


While all of the council agrees that the city’s increasing unhoused population is at an emergency level and needs to be addressed immediately, members don’t agree on process. 
In his newsletter following the passage of the Agate resolution, council member Rainville said the budget amendment allowed Agate to bypass the normal funding process and “jump the line on other housing providers such as Common Bond, Avivo, and Aeon.
“To help prevent this practice in the future, I co-authored a legislative directive with CMs Vetaw and Palmisano to have staff give a presentation outlining the standard process for my colleagues,” he wrote. 
Council members in support of the funding argued that the possible loss of the Agate facility was urgent and needed to be addressed immediately. 
 


 


During the Sept. 19 meeting, Chughtai said the Agate grant is actually cost effective. To completely rebuild a facility like Agate’s, she said it would require an entity willing and able to do it and cost around $40 million, noting she believed it’s worth providing the $1.5 million grant is worth avoiding the closure of an already established facility. 
This is not the first time the council has been divided over process while budgeting. 
In July, the council passed a police contract budget that deviated from what the Frey administration proposed.
 In that case, the change was neither signed nor vetoed by the mayor.
Update: This story has been updated to reflect that the 510 Agate location does not use the county’s coordinated entry program.

Walking north down 3rd Avenue South toward the corner of East 31st Street in south Minneapolis, a pedestrian detour sign points foot traffic west down 31st Street. But you can’t walk far, at least not legally. A massive gate meets foot traffic looking to cross under the Interstate 35W overpass. 
Why is it there? 
The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) evicted an encampment under the 35W bridge on 31st Street in early August. MnDOT has jurisdiction over the infrastructure under expressway overpasses. Shortly after the eviction, a fence was erected around the sidewalk to prevent future camps. 
 


 


A MnDOT spokesperson sent this statement to MinnPost regarding the fence: “Highway right-of-way and roadways are not safe places for human beings to live and be and for safety reasons fencing needed to be installed in this location.” 
MnDOT coordinated with service providers and state and county partners to provide information, support and alternatives to people at the site including the Hennepin County Streets to Housing team, according to the statement.

Rent control is on the St. Paul City Council’s agenda once again
 






 


While they didn’t want to be quoted by name in this story, several people walking around the area near the fence on a recent afternoon said they didn’t feel comfortable walking through the area before the fence was erected either because so many people and tents were under the overpass. 
There are anywhere between 300 to 500 unhoused people living outside in Hennepin county, said Daniel Weckman, outreach manager for local nonprofit Twin Cities Recovery Project. 
 


 


For organizations working with the city’s unhoused population, displacements like the one in August force groups to start over in building relationships and finding resources for the affected people, Weckman said. 
“Every time they do one of these breakdown-and-moves, somebody gets retraumatized and we have to go and start over, find them all over again and try to find these resources for the individual,” he said. 
 


 


Dispersing camps doesn’t fix the problems preventing people living outside from finding shelter, Weckman noted. Instead, most move on to the next place. In the case of those who moved from the 35W overpass, many moved to spaces around the former Kmart site at Lake Street and 1st Avenue South and around the intersection of Stevens Avenue and East Lake Street. However, the Twin Cities Recovery Project hasn’t located all who’d been identified as living under the overpass. 
Often when a camp is dispersed, people spread out. It usually takes at least a week for people to congregate again, Weckman said. 
 


 


“I’m just hoping that when we do find them we find the people we’re looking for,” Weckman said.

Twin Cities Recovery Project serves as a daytime shelter. People can come to the nonprofit’s offices at 3400 East Lake Street in south Minneapolis and 1011 West Broadway in north Minneapolis from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The center distributes donations of food and clothing it collects to people in need who show up. 
Outside of Twin Cities Recovery Project, Weckman said people seeking shelter can use a program called 
Adult Shelter Connect
, which aims to give access to every open bed in Hennepin County and Ramsey County. 
Long term, Weckman said a permanent solution is needed. 
 


 


“We can’t keep having these small encampments and breaking them down and moving people, breaking them down and moving people. We need a brick-and-mortar solution,” he said.

The Unity Community Mediation Team (UCMT), one of the oldest public safety-focused nonprofit organizations in Minneapolis, is seeking nearly $2 million from the city to continue its work. 
Al Flowers, one of UCMT’s original members, said to achieve the goal of cultivating trust between community and the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) – after decades of volunteer work – the group needs city funding to continue its work.
“Now, the system is saying they want a community based solution,” said Flowers. “That is what we have created.”
 


 


Origins of UCMT
The UCMT began way back in December 2003, when original founders Ron Edwards and Clyde Bellecourt brought the concerns of community members to the U.S. Department of Justice regarding multiple incidents of police violence, namely against Black and Indigenous residents of the city. That led to the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by the department and UCMT, prompting weekly meetings between the two sides for five years – called the Police Community Relations Council (PCRC) – about the implementation of 106 action items in the document, which were nearly 70% complete by 2008. But that year, city officials decided not to continue the PCRC, which remained stagnant until the murder of George Floyd by a white MPD officer in 2020 jump-started the effort once more and the document was renewed in 2022. 
Since then, the UCMT’s main functions have involved providing resources for community members who have had negative interactions with MPD officers. UCMT volunteers then relay the complaints to the department, review body camera footage of the incident and, when necessary, mediate between the individuals and the officers involved in order to come to a resolution.

“We’ve been doing this for over 20 years with the police department, so they’ve gotten to know us and they trust us,” said mental health professional and UCMT member Mark Anderson. “So if we say ‘a family says that you beat up this child,’ they’ll say, ‘Well, come on downtown and look at the video,’ and so we can help mediate between the community and the police department because we have trust on both sides.”
In addition to providing community members with access to police services, the group is also trying to improve access to officers as well in an effort to improve relations between the department and residents. Since May, according to the group, every new MPD officer has been assigned a “community mentor” by the UCMT – someone who can familiarize officers with their patrol area and the people who live there.
 


 


“We’re developing a network so the officers could feel the support and the connection with the community from their side,” Flowers said. “It’s not just us learning to trust officers, it’s officers learning to trust community and work together.”
Future of UCMT
During the renewal of the UCMT’s mediation efforts following Floyd’s murder, the outpouring by the city’s younger residents during the protests in 2020 prompted the group’s elders to start thinking about the future of their efforts. That resulted in the creation of the UCMT’s Young People Task Force, led in part by Flowers’ son Alfred Flowers Jr. 
“I was standing outside at the Third Precinct protesting when George Floyd was murdered, and I don’t regret a second of it, but what I also realized was OK, now what’s next? What do we want to get done?”
 


 


The task force has been active in relaying concerns to MPD and getting policies created or changed. One example was the role they played in helping to get no-knock warrants banned for good following the killing of Amir Locke by a Minneapolis SWAT team in 2022. That same year, the task force also brought awareness to the lack of MPD policy regarding DNA collection of juveniles after a 13-year-old boy was detained by officers and allegedly had samples taken. That eventually led to legislation passed at the Capitol to prevent DNA collection of minors without parental consent.
 


 


Now with 15 members who meet each Thursday, the task force has also been working to strengthen the bond between community members and police through events like group fishing and police and UCMT handing out free backpacks to kids ahead of the school year.
All of the services provided by UCMT volunteers are free of charge, but that model is becoming more unsustainable for the volunteers, said Al Flowers. During a presentation to the City Council’s Public Health and Safety Committee, the organization is now asking the city for about $937,000 a year for two years to help maintain the eight sites where UCMT volunteers operate. 
The sites include UCMT headquarters, NAACP Minneapolis and New Salem Baptist Church in north Minneapolis, as well as Indigenous Protector Movement, Little Earth Residents Association, Cedar Riverside Opportunity Center, Voice of East Africa Women and Nuestra Lucha on the city’s south side. 
Because the sites are community-based, the funds split between the eight sites would not only go toward helping to continue providing UCMT services at each site, but they’d also go toward funding the other services provided by each of the organizations represented.
 


 


“While the UCMT is the overseer of (our programs) at these community satellite sites, this is not strictly for UCMT – we’re trying to make sure that those other sites that we have are funded as well,” Flowers Jr. said. “So it’s not as if the UCMT is getting all of that money. We just had to break it down so that each site is taken care of.”
Ward 9 Council member and Public Health and Safety Committee chair, Jason Chavez, said during an interview that he’s very interested in the goal behind the idea for the community sites, which is to help immigrants and communities of color file police reports, but how it’ll be funded remains unclear. 
“The appealing thing to me is for the city to be able to support community based sites to make sure that people can feel safe filing police complaints,” Chavez said. “Now in regards to the funding stream, that has to be a conversation had by Council. Are we funding the entire project? Are we funding one site and piloting it and seeing what this could look like?”
Chavez said he plans to have follow-up conversations with UCMT, as well as with the city attorney and civil rights department to ensure the sites wouldn’t run afoul of any city policies or the ongoing consent decree process.

Metro Transit is eyeing a restructure of its local and express bus network as early as next year, as it accounts for pandemic-induced changes to regional travel patterns. 
The changes, outlined in a process called 
Network Now
, call for concentrating bus service on some of its heavily-used local and express routes, creating new routes to significantly reduce travel time between suburban locales, as well as support the development of the region’s bus rapid transit and light rail lines. 
In the years before the pandemic began, Metro Transit was hemorrhaging ridership and cutting service as riders began driving more to work to take advantage of cheapening gas and parking. Meanwhile, the agency also struggled to recruit and retain drivers. 
 


 


When the pandemic began in March 2020, ridership plummeted almost overnight, as the agency’s remaining commuters began to work from home. 
Census data shows the amount of workers who live in the seven-county metro area who worked from home more than tripled
 in 2023 compared to 2019.
Since the pandemic began, Metro Transit’s bus route ridership has rebounded, slowly but surely. 
Bus ridership through June
 was at 16.6 million, an 11% increase compared to ridership at the same time in 2023. It’s a far cry, though, from what ridership was at the same time in 2019, 
which was at 26.3 million
.

Data from Metro Transit shows ridership, which is concentrated on 16 routes serving Minneapolis and St. Paul, tends to peak more strongly 
in the early afternoon
, where riders are more likely to be shopping and running errands than they are commuting to work. Meanwhile, transfers between buses in the two downtowns are also declining, while transfers at suburban transit centers are up. Services in the suburbs that mimic ridehail services such as Uber and Lyft, called microtransit, were 
some of the first services in the region
 to recover over 100% of their pre-pandemic ridership.

As a result, Metro Transit is calling for service increases to its busiest routes, while also deploying a network of all-day regional express routes operating from downtown Minneapolis to connect park-and-rides in Minnetonka, Brooklyn Park, Blaine, Maplewood and Woodbury. Local buses or 
microtransit services
 would radiate out from those hubs. 
 


 


The proposal also calls for creating new crosstown connections, reducing travel times between the outlying suburbs. One such connection is a so-called crosstown route connecting the communities of Blaine, Brooklyn Park, and Osseo on Highway 252, 85th Avenue, Brooklyn Boulevard, and Jefferson Highway. The proposal would change what is an over two-hour bus ride today down to about 30 minutes. 
East-west routes are what Brooklyn Park officials have sought for years, and the city of Brooklyn Park submitted comments as part of the Blue Line Extension light rail project’s environmental review process requesting planning for such routes happen before construction begins. 
Brooklyn Park city councilmember Boyd Morson expressed at a July 29 meeting the importance of east-west bus service serving his community. 
“I think this is something that we can implement right now to get our residents east and west side and the central district as well as in and out of our city with opportunities, and whatever the reason may be,” Morson said. 
 


 


 


 


Another such connection includes increasing Route 94 service to run seven days a week for the first time since the Green Line opened, when Route 94 service was cut back. On weekends, service would run anywhere from every 30 to 60 minutes. 
Downtown Minneapolis resident Ben Doxtator welcomes the potential changes. 
“Plenty of times I wanted to catch (Route 94) on a Sunday or a weekend. Even if it just ran on a Saturday it would be great,” Doxtator said while handling his bike on the Green Line on a recent Saturday evening.
The service improvements come with elimination of other routes, some of which have been suspended since the pandemic began. By Metro Transit’s count, they plan to eliminate 53 routes, which include freeway routes serving south Minneapolis, Richfield, Bloomington, Brooklyn Park, Blaine, White Bear Lake and the communities to the north of Lake Minnetonka. They also plan to eliminate suspended local routes that are or will soon be served by faster, more frequent options, such as the 12, 16, 19, 27, and 84. 
 


 


Metro Transit staff were supposed to present the proposed changes at the Met Council’s Transportation Committee on Aug. 26, but did not because the committee lacked a quorum. Staff will instead present the proposals at the Transportation Committee on Sep. 9. Transportation Committee chair Deb Barber posted on X.com, the site formerly known as Twitter, that the delay 
will not result in a delay of implementation
. 
The transportation committee, as well as the full Met Council, will consider setting a hearing date and releasing the plan for public comment that week. Once approved, the agency plans to solicit comments from riders about the proposed changes until Nov. 15. The agency will then present an updated plan before Met Council for approval in early 2025.  
Metro Transit is required by state law and Met Council policy to get feedback from riders about the proposed changes, because some of the changes will result in riders having no alternative service.
“The public hearing will be part of a more extensive public engagement process including five Metro Transit sponsored meetings and other community meetings,” Metro Transit spokesperson John Komarek wrote in an e-mail.

From Other Nonprofit Media showcases select work from other nonprofit news sites around the nation.
 


This 
story
 originally ran at North News.
A proposed light rail project connecting Brooklyn Park to downtown with a critical stretch in North Minneapolis has its dreamers and detractors. 
The dreamers see a significant transportation project bringing unprecedented investment to transform West Broadway Avenue into a destination like Bourbon Street, with restaurants, shopping and entertainment. 
 


 


Those against the proposed Blue Line extension see another predominantly African American community becoming a casualty to progress. Critics call it Rondo 2.0 as a hark back to the thriving Black neighborhood in Saint Paul wiped out in the 1950s and 60s by the construction of I-94. Critics worry that light rail and the development that follows could quickly gentrify the Northside and price people out of their homes and businesses. 
Project planners say they have learned from the past and vow to create a light rail line that serves everyone. They point to hundreds of hours of community engagement, sometimes meeting with people in residential driveways and taking feedback seriously enough to change parts of the route. Officials say minimizing displacement is at the heart of the project. 
The proposed Blue Line extension will face critical judgment this fall when municipalities along the line vote on whether to give formal consent to the project. 
From Target Field station, a northbound train would travel along North 7th Street, then 10th Avenue, and turn onto Washington Avenue. The train would then crossover I-94 on a new bridge that would extend to 21st Avenue. The train would then merge onto West Broadway Avenue at James.

Should the project receive consent from local governments, construction on the 13.4-mile route could begin within two years, with trains running by 2030. Costs could rise above the current estimate of $3.2 billion. 
How the cities will vote is anyone’s guess. Consent is far from guaranteed, and both Northside wards are a no-vote for now. 
The Minneapolis City Council will hold a public hearing on Sept. 12 and vote on the consent question on Oct. 2. 
Ward 5 Councilman Jeremiah Ellison favors light rail serving his ward but feels the project team needs to offer more details on how they will care for impacted residents and businesses. He wants to slow down the timeline until anti-displacement policies are in place. 
 


 


“I’m sure the effort they have put in with community engagement feels like more than what they’ve done before, but all that tells me is that the bar was really low,” Ellison said. “I think the way to mitigate concerns about the route is to be rock-solid on how you plan to go forward with anti-displacement. 
“You’re rushing a decision that does not have champions at this moment. And they could have champions.” 
An informal Blue Line timeline 
A light rail plan connecting the northwest suburbs to downtown has been in the works for over 20 years. Hennepin County discussed the idea in the 1980s. It wasn’t until 2012 that transportation officials proposed a route using the median on Olson Memorial Highway to bring light rail to Target Field.
The route needed the approval of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, which owned the median’s right of way. Officials tried to negotiate with BNSF to acquire the corridor for light rail. BNSF refused, and Blue Line planners proposed routes down Lowry Avenue or West Broadway in 2020. 
 


 


Project planners conducted technical studies of both routes and chose West Broadway a year later because the feedback, they said, showed “a strong community preference” for this route.

There was immediate resistance. Residents in the Lyn Park neighborhood opposed a leg of track proposed for Lyndale Avenue. They felt it would disrupt their quiet neighborhood. West Broadway businesses feared they would not survive, much like some small businesses disappeared during the construction of the Green Line on University Avenue in Saint Paul. Community leaders also saw the death of a historic and culturally important corridor that stages block parties and community festivals. 
Project planners held community meetings and drive-way sessions, answering questions and fielding a barrage of suggestions. And they listened.
They removed Lyndale from the map and drew a bridge over I-94 to travel down Washington Avenue for light rail. They also sparred much of West Broadway by drawing the route to travel down 21st Avenue. It is at James that the light rail would join West Broadway. Officials said this change in route would require fewer property acquisitions. 
 


 


“Minimizing displacement is the lens through which every major decision is made on this project.,” said Blue Line spokesman Kyle Mianulli. “This commitment has shaped the proposed route in substantial ways. (The current proposed route) allowed us to avoid impacting many more properties than if we had stayed on West Broadway. 
“We have been in contact with every property identified in these preliminary plans as a potential full acquisition. As planning continues and designs are refined in future phases, staff are always working to find creative ways to reduce and avoid property impacts and continue discussions with property owners.” 
As project planners met with neighborhood groups, conducted impact surveys, and designed route and station concepts, an anti-displacement work group met to make policy recommendations for protecting vulnerable businesses and homeowners from construction and steep property tax hikes. 
State lawmakers recently allocated $10 million for displacement, and a new Anti-displacement Community Prosperity Board began meeting this summer. Its job is to identify needs and work with governments and organizations to put support in place before the first shovel breaks ground. 
Ricardo Perez, a community activist on the new board, is encouraged, saying the steady engagement and commitment to anti-displacement is unprecedented. 
Officials could use various tools to mitigate displacement, including housing support like rent freezes, property tax relief, eviction protection, and more intentional construction of affordable housing. 
Businesses could get compensation for lost business, relocation costs, and new parking as part of the construction. 
Perez believes the small amount put forward by lawmakers may unlock other money for anti-displacement. 
“I believe we have enough talent in our network, the community, organizations, and the right government people in the room to forward a different way of building these types of projects,” he said. “We need more than $10 million or $20 million. I think there will be a snowball effect of funding that could come into the corridor. With the right people in the room, we can hyper-focus on the people and businesses who could be disproportionately impacted by the project.” 
At recent meetings, more people have come forward to support the proposed Blue Line extension. However, distrust continues throughout the Northside, especially among those working and living along the route. 
‘People in limbo’ 
The North Minneapolis portion of West Broadway Avenue on the route has a Main Street USA feel, especially around the bustling intersection at Penn Avenue. There’s a dance studio, barbershop, the beloved radio station KMOJ, and a modern mixed-use building with Broadway Liquor Outlet at ground level and 103 apartments above. 
Owner Dean Rose developed the corner after the 2011 tornado destroyed his business across the intersection. He opened Broadway Liqour in 2016, and his business benefits from some 30,000 vehicles that pass through the intersection daily. Light rail will undoubtedly make it more difficult for cars to turn into his parking lot and change how trucks turn in to deliver inventory. 
“When that happens once or twice to a consumer, they’ll go find another place to shop because it’s too inconvenient,” Rose said. “That’s why (bus) is a better option. It’s cheaper, and we can put in more routes that will vastly improve services to North Minneapolis. 
“They say that they want to provide great access to everything. But in reality, they just want a means to get people downtown, to the airport and Mall of America. It’s not to actually serve this community but to go through it.”
Rose and others say they’ve expressed their ideas to project planners but never see their feedback incorporated into route or engineering changes. “They act like they’re listening to us, but they’re not,” he said. “We express ourselves, they have another meeting and come back with less. They never come back with, say, a parking plan. That’s why I stopped going to meetings because they are not considering people in the community.” 
Diane Robinson, the owner of Hollywood Studio of Dance, said she had spoken with one project staff member who gave her their card and invited her to call to discuss concerns. Robinson said the person never returned her calls. 
She worries about her business surviving the construction period. 
“They are looking at the area and doing these surveys, but they don’t care because they don’t live here,” Robinson said. 
The Blue Line must acquire the Five Points Building, home to KMOJ radio, which recently signed a long-term lease extension. KMOJ board president Dr. David Hamlar said the station has had discussions with project planners, who have said they will work with KMOJ to move to a new location on the Northside. 
KMOJ has used public service announcements to attract citizens’ participation in Blue Line hearings or written calls for feedback. 
“They are listening,” Hamlar said of the project team. “But it has been a little bit slow. If they want to engage us (Northsiders), they need to put us on a front burner and not be reactionary.” 
Teto Wilson, who owns Wilson’s Image Barbers and Stylists on 2126 West Broadway, still opposes the light rail plan but has shifted energy into working with anti-displacement leaders for potential compensation should construction hurt his business.
“If certain things are done properly and they put measures in place to make sure we are able to survive, then we’ll be fine,” he said. “Hypothetically, if they say the rules are the rules and you have to figure it out for yourself, then we may not survive. 
“There are just so many unknowns, and it’s kind of leaving a lot of people in limbo.”
Dreamers say, ‘Why not?’ 
Mike Tate, a youth coach at North Commons Park for 46 years, wrote a heartfelt letter to transportation officials supporting the Blue Line. 
In it, he wrote about losing one of his players to gun violence and was present on Plymouth Avenue in 1967 when racial tensions flared and fire destroyed some blocks. 
“This is not about a train or stops or even buildings,” he wrote. “(This) is about opportunity and hope for our young people and an opportunity to overcome so many demons our community has suffered since the mid-60s.”
On a recent Saturday, project manager Dan Soler led a bus tour of the route connecting Brooklyn Park, Crystal, Robbinsdale, and North Minneapolis with downtown. The crowd was small and Blue Line-friendly. 
He is calm and affable when he stands in front of a room full of critics and explains why the proposed Blue Line light rail extension route is good for them. 
Before boarding a Metro Transit bus at UROC on Plymouth Avenue for the tour, Soler appealed to the group by leading them in a chorus of “why not?” Take the mural of musicians that greet motorists turning onto Broadway from I-94. It provides a perfect gateway to a destination, he said. 
“Why not another Bourbon Street? Why not another Beale Street?” Soler said of the two iconic centers of American culture and commerce in New Orleans and Memphis, Tenn.
Among those boarding the bus that morning were a realtor, a developer, and a businessman from Albertville. Hennepin County Commissioner Irene Fernando, whose district represents the Northside, joined the bus tour near the end to provide rousing support for the project. 
The bus tour was part of a series of four “Dream” sessions led by Northsider Brett Buckner, director of OneMN. Buckner’s team designed sessions to unite people and share ideas on what they want light rail to bring to the community. 
“The thing about West Broadway is there are so many opportunities, and we are the last to be developed,” Buckner said. “This is our moment.”
John Jamison, who chairs the Northside Resident Redevelopment Council board, said Blue Line proponents need to communicate better the benefits of having light rail in North Minneapolis. 
He said some Northsiders are skeptical because they are not used to a process that asks them to deliver feedback to help a good plan evolve. 
“They need to know they can write this new chapter,” Jamison said. “Instead of saying the county is doing this to us, we can change that position to say they’re doing this for us.” 
The bus stopped at the Capri Theater so that Fernando, dressed in her “Commish” baseball jersey, could join the last part of the tour. 
She took the microphone Soler used to guide the tour to generate excitement about light rail. Critics accuse Fernando of avoiding contentious meetings with residents. 
“For too long, government has pre-negotiated your vision,” said Fernando, who chairs the county board. “We can look at each parcel of land and not limit ourselves to the ideas of the past. Every resident of the Northside should be able to age here, get jobs here, buy cool stuff here, and have our hard-earned money stay here. I look forward to the transformation that is possible here.”

Once again, St. Paul City Council will likely be assessing proposed changes to the city’s rent control ordinance this fall. 
But the changes proposed by St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter aren’t going over well among small landlords with aging buildings. 
The once sweeping 
rent control cap
 that limits rent increases to no more than 3% in a 12-month period passed via 2021 city referendum has already been whittled down by previous city councils that enacted a 20-year exemption for new development. Now Carter is proposing a change to the policy that would make all properties built after Dec. 31 of 2004 exempt from rent control indefinitely.
 


 


The city estimates approximately 95% of its rental units with a Fire Certificate of Occupancy were built prior to 2005, according to Ramsey County Parcel data reviewed by St. Paul Department of Planning and Economic Development and Department of Safety and Inspection staff.
Joe Hughes, owns and works to lease “naturally occurring affordable housing” for Union Park Management in St. Paul. Naturally occurring affordable housing refers to residential properties that are considered affordable but are not federally subsidized. Generally these are older buildings such as brownstones. 
Hughes sees the proposed change as great for large-scale developers, but not so much for small local landlords. Looking at the whittled down ordinance, Hughes asks: “Who is this ordinance really helping?”

Rent control is on the St. Paul City Council’s agenda once again
 






 


Related | Subtle change in St. Paul’s new rent control proposal sets firm exemption cutoff date, hopes to boost housing
Many of the properties that would still be under rent control if Carter’s proposal was adopted are aging and in need of repair, he said.  At one point, Union Park Management bought a building “substantially below what it was worth because of rent control.” A one-bedroom in the apartment once ran for about $450, he said. But the building was “falling apart” and needed substantial repairs. Because of this, the company was able to apply for an exemption and still raise rent substantially. So often, even older buildings are caught under an exemption. There is fear that not raising rent now on theses St. Paul buildings means not being able to make necessary repairs in the future, he said. 
 


 


“What it comes down to is, the days of having tenants with a substantially below market-rate rent deal are over,” Hughes said, claiming landlords are penalized now for offering low rent.  
Nate Hood is a member of the city’s planning commission and the owner of a small duplex in St. Paul, which was built in the early 1900s. This property would not be exempt from the rent control ordinance under Carter’s proposal. Outside of his role on the planning commission, Hood works in urban planning and economic development and helped start a group called Sustain St. Paul, a development, sustainability and affordable housing advocacy group. 
“The rent control policy that we have right now is really the worst of both worlds because there are enough exemptions where it doesn’t necessarily protect renters. However, it is strict enough for developers and new investors not to feel comfortable putting new capital into the system here,” Hood said. 
 


 


Hood said because his property would not be exempt, he’s actually raised rent by 3% every year rather than keeping it flat. Previously, Hood would keep the rent flat until the tenant moved out, then reset the rent to the market rate for the new tenant. There was a 2023 amendment made to the ordinance to allow for “partial vacancy decontrol,” which allows landlords to increase rents by up to 8% plus inflation, measured by Consumer Price Index, after a “just cause” vacancy. But for many, this isn’t enough not to increase rent, Hood said.   
 


 


“I always have to be increasing rents and it kind of stinks because I like tenants and I don’t want to put them out. I want them to be happy,” Hood said. 
Meanwhile, large developers have remained relatively quiet about the proposed change to rent control. When asked for comment on Carter’s proposal, Ryan Companies, the lead developer of the Highland Bridge project, sent the following statement from Maureen Michalski, the executive overseeing the site: “We look forward to learning more about the specifics of Mayor Carter’s comprehensive housing proposal and how it might impact developments like Highland Bridge. Our priority remains to contribute to the city’s vision for sustainable and inclusive growth.”
Last year, 
Ryan paused housing development at Highland Bridge, claiming the pause was due to an inability to find financing after St. Paul’s implementation of rent control
. At the time, Michalski said, short of a full repeal, Ryan would advocate for a 30-year new construction exemption rather than the current 20-year. Notably, that is not the mayor’s current proposal. 
This proposal of course still needs to go to St. Paul City Council and, while the body has talked with the Carter administration about changes to rent stabilization in the past, Council President Mitra Jalali said these conversations were always “very high level.” 
 


 


Far more conversation and data needs to be shared before the council can make a decision on how any changes to rent control would work, Jalali said. 
“Ultimately our council sets policy in the city, our council is the only thing that can connect with the ordinance, our council needs to be looking at the full scope of housing and moving holistically,” she said. 
The council president also pointed out that rent control is only one factor in lowered housing development. For example, inflation and high interest rates deter development, which are outside the city’s control, Jalali pointed out. 
“I think we should understand the factors that are unique to St. Paul,” Jalali said. “I’m also careful not to prescribe the issue entirely to our ordinance.”

Minnesota court officials are looking at increasing juror per diems as a possible method to improve representativeness among juries amid a lack of racial diversity in the Twin Cities metro area and across the state. 
A 
MinnPost analysis
 of state court data found glaring racial disparities in the make-ups of juries for criminal proceedings going back 10 years. In an effort to combat those disparities, a previously established workgroup at the Minnesota Judicial Branch is looking at increasing pay for low-income jurors. 
The juror per diem rate was first enshrined in statute in Minnesota in 1977 at $15 per day and a reimbursement of $.15 per mile traveled by the juror. In 1993, the statute was repealed and the responsibility for setting the rate fell to the Supreme Court, which raised the rate two years later to $30. 
 


 


The per diem was decreased to $20 in 2003 due to budget restraints and again to $10 in 2008 before being raised again in 2016 to $20, where it sits today.

Rent control is on the St. Paul City Council’s agenda once again
 






 


During a Judicial Council meeting held earlier this month, the judges discussed the challenges within the process for paneling juries, including the financial consequences caused by serving on a jury.

“It falls into two categories: it’s either ‘I’m a doctor or a dentist or a business owner and I can’t take time off so please let me out of it,’ or it’s the person whose got two kids at home, and if they’re doing jury duty they’re not getting paid,” said Third District Judge Joseph Bueltel. “We’re losing people on both ends of the spectrum.”
A report conducted by the National Center for State Courts released in 2022 found that all states offer some kind of juror compensation, ranging from $4 in Illinois to $50 in North Dakota, with Minnesota in the middle of the pack. The report argues that compensation for jurors is crucial to the functioning of state courts, not only increasing candor and enthusiasm in participation but representation as well. 
 


 


 


 


An example of that is a pilot program started in March 2022 in San Francisco County. That program increased juror compensation in criminal trials from $15 to $100 per day in an effort to improve representation on juries by eliminating the financial barrier that often prevents low-income residents from serving. By August 2023, the staggering results showed that 84% of participants were only able to serve due to the increase in compensation, and the racial demographics of participants was nearly identical to the racial diversity of San Francisco County after only a year. 
“Being able to serve made me feel more connected to my community and involved in democracy,” said one participant in the pilot program. “I learned so much about the justice system.”
The jury workgroup, which presented during the Judicial Council, mentioned various improvements they’re working towards, including mental health services for jurors after serving, shift protection for jurors who need to take time off to serve and increasing the per diem, pending additional funds from the Legislature. 
In its supplemental budget request to the Legislature this past session, the Judicial Branch did add a funding request to increase juror per diems, but that part of the request wasn’t fulfilled, said Kim Pleticha, the Judicial Branch’s director of public affairs. 
 


 


“Jury per diem is something the Minnesota Judicial Branch cares deeply about,” Pleticha said in a statement. “The Judicial Council has not yet finalized the Branch’s legislative budget request for the 2025 legislative session, but jury per diem certainly is being discussed.”

It was an exaggeration made in the fog of war that turned into a tactic that contributed to the calming of two cities following the murder of George Floyd in May of 2020: 
Much of the destruction that occurred during the evenings of rioting, looting and arson were the work of outsiders, the state’s political leadership said. These troublemakers were coming in to exploit the pain caused by Floyd’s death, Gov. Tim Walz and the other leaders asserted. 
While subsequent arrests and prosecutions did not bear out that narrative — at least not as the predominant cause of destruction — it was prominent in public officials’ and community leaders’ statements.
 


 


During early morning media briefings held in the state emergency management center in downtown St. Paul, Walz, his public safety leadership and the mayors of the two largest cities tried to keep residents informed in late May, 2020. Demonstrations that became civil unrest that became rioting had marred both Minneapolis and St. Paul on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights with damage estimates in the $500 million range.
Related | Seven Days in May
State and city leadership was attempting to respond to the numbers and the violence that caught most by surprise. Since Walz was elevated to the national Democratic presidential ticket, much has been said and written about the timing of the deployment of state forces — the State Patrol and the National Guard — primarily whether it was deployed too late to stop the burning of hundreds of businesses and institutions. But one set of remarks, seemingly made off the cuff and without evidence, might have been key to ending the destruction less than a week after Floyd was killed.
“We’re going to start releasing who some of these people are, and they’ll be able to start tracing that history of where they’re at, and what they’re doing on the ‘dark web’ and how they’re organizing,” Walz said 
during one briefing
. “I think our best estimate right now that I heard is about 20% that are Minnesotans and about 80% are outside.”




St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter echoed that assessment with more numbers that would prove inaccurate.
 


 


“Every single person we arrested last night, I’m told, was from out of state. Those folks who are agitating and inciting are taking advantage of the pain, of the hurt, of the frustration, of the anger of the very real and legitimate sadness that so many of our community members feel to advocate for the destruction of our communities,” Carter said.

By the next day, the elected officials walked back the numbers but not their contention that outside agitators were playing a role in the violence.
“This morning I shared with you arrest data received in my morning police briefing which I later learned to be inaccurate. I have taken further steps to safeguard our ability to provide relevant and accurate information and will ensure that those are (provided) in the future,” Carter said. “And I take full responsibility for that.”
But while the data was sketchy, the theory remained.
 


 


“So as you saw this expand across the United States, and you start to see whether it be domestic terrorism, whether it be ideological extremist to fund the group, or whether it be international destabilization of how our country works, those elements are present in all of this,” Walz said early Saturday morning while announcing a full mobilization of the National Guard.
“Our great cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are under assault by people who do not share our values, who do not value life in the work that went into this, and certainly are not here to honor George Floyd,” Walz continued. “They need to see today that that line will stop and the order needs to be restored.”

Added Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey: “I want to be very, very clear: The people that are doing this are not Minneapolis residents. They are coming in largely from outside of the city, from outside of the region to prey on everything that we have built over the last several decades.

“The dynamic has changed over the last several days. If you looked at Tuesday, it was largely peaceful protest. The vast majority peaceful, the vast majority of people from our city with a small group of people looking to have intentional disturbance. Gradually, that shift was made and we saw more and more people coming from outside of the city. We saw more and more people looking to cause violence in our communities, and I have to say it is not acceptable. If you’re concerned, I get it. If you have family members or friends that are even considering protesting, this is no longer about protesting.”
 


 


There is little question that the political leadership believed that the cities were targets, based on intelligence they received. Late in the week the mayor of Hudson, Wisconsin, 
asked for help
 from that state’s National Guard due to official reports that “70,000 to 75,000 agitators are traveling today from locations such as Kansas City, Chicago, Ohio and other parts of the country to the Twin Cities.” That was an estimate that was also given credence 
by the Pentagon
 in discussing possible responses.

By the weekend, a tweet from Frey pointed to “white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors.”


We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region.
— Mayor Jacob Frey (@MayorFrey) 
May 30, 2020


Politifact 
determined
 that the outside agitator claims were mostly false. While there were 
incidents of radical conservatives
 being charged, most 
were from the state 
and not affiliated with outside groups. 
Walz did react to criticism that Minnesotans were not taking responsibility for what was happening in the streets, and therefore not taking responsibility for the racial conditions that contributed to the anger.
 


 


“I just think candidly, I certainly want to believe that it’s outside more, and that might go to the problem that we have of saying ‘it can’t be Minnesotans, it can’t be Minnesotans who did this,’” Walz said Sunday. And while he continued to think there were outside elements involved, “the catalyst that started all of this was the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota, and that was our problem.”
Leadership took other steps to try to respond to protest demands, most notably the 
arrest of Derek Chauvin
. In addition, curfews were imposed and freeway access to the cities was closed in the evening.

After a chaotic start to the state’s response, by week’s end the State Patrol, the law enforcement division of the Department of Natural Resources and the National Guard had developed a mission and were deploying in larger numbers. Because they do not have arrest authority, the Guard would serve as support to the patrol and local law enforcement. It kept watch on institutions like the State Capitol, police headquarters and public works. It provided escorts for fire and emergency medical response crews. Then-Adjutant General Jon Jensen had insisted that his men and women be armed in response to what he said were known threats against them.
Because so much of the protests were aimed at the Minneapolis Police Department, political leadership tried to stress that the patrol and guard were different, not deserving of anger and protests.
 


 


“The National Guard just a week ago was administering COVID-19 tests to help people,” Attorney General Keith Ellison said. “The presence you see on the street: don’t react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department. It’s not the same group. They have different leadership, different authority. Their job is to try to bring peace and calm back again.”

Still, the official response was not yet enough. Friday, the day after the Third Precinct was abandoned and destroyed by fire, nighttime unrest continued. The curfews did not deter people from being out on the streets in Minneapolis.
Later Saturday afternoon, Ellison led 
another press conference
, this time with religious and community leaders, pleading with people to obey the curfew that was to begin again that evening. For more than an hour, people who were mostly non-politicians urged people in Minneapolis to protest during daylight hours but to then go home.

After making that request, Ellison explained why.
“Because the people who are trying to tarnish the reputation of the nobel protest for justice are out there trying to mix in with the crowd so that people will say, look at those protesters, their cause can’t be just, they’re causing trouble,” he said. 
People he called “evil elements” are not for justice for George Floyd, “they are against it.”
“To be on the street after 8 means that we can’t get you separated from the bad people,” Ellison said. “We’re urging you to let the national guard have the street after 8.”

Imam Asad Zaman, executive director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, spoke of infiltrators trying to “hijack this righteous protest” and who use local residents as “human shields to hide themselves from law enforcement.”
Finally, Justin Terrell, then the executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage, asked people to stay home and take care of each other. “I’m asking you, take the day, check on your people, prepare, pack a bag, protect your home. But do not end up in the crosshairs of an ideological battle that’s got nothing to do with us and never has. We are not your pawns,” he said.
“White people from other communities are coming into my community, our community, for some sort of perverse poetry,” Terrell said.
And later Saturday, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar said she believed the grief of the community was being exploited.
“People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” she said in a statement. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.”
Whether the pleas were heard or whether people stayed home or returned home by 8 on their own, the numbers were down significantly Saturday evening. State Patrol teams cleared out those who remained, and the evening ended with much less disruption. That’s not to say there wasn’t some damage and some arrests. But a major effort by law enforcement via a coordinated effort by state and local police buoyed by higher numbers of officers and guardsmen ended the unrest. 
The 
after-action report
 conducted by Wilder Research quoted what it called a state law enforcement official: “There was a mass deployment of munitions on Nicollet Avenue with a large crowd, and that was a tactic communicated to us through chain of command via the executive saying go down there and give them everything you got. It needed to end tonight.”
Reporters on the scene noted the difference between Saturday night and the previous three evenings.


I have seen a number of international journalists trying to find some ‘action’ and being let down. Police really have done an effective job at preventing A repeat of last night.

Shortly after midnight, state Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell, who was serving as a media liaison during the unrest, 
said the situation
 was greatly improved Saturday.
“One, there was clarity … and there was an overwhelming number of resources that were brought to bear, which was critical,” he said, noting that the number of Guardsmen jumped from around 700 to more than 4,000. There also was “incredible compliance” with the 8 p.m. curfew.
“There was a tremendous level of community support for the curfew, as hard as that is to do in an open and civil society,” Schnell said.

The Sunday briefing was the first one in a week in which Walz and his public safety leaders appeared relieved, rather than harried.
“I say on the backside of last night that our goal was accomplished,” said State Patrol Chief Matt Langer. “Fires were not set. We didn’t see the lawlessness. We didn’t see the risk to personal safety, the crime, the looting, the property destruction.”
Sunday afternoon, 
Walz turned over the prosecution of Chauvin
 and the other police officers to Ellison, another request of protesters. And by Sunday afternoon, the protests were focused on a march on I-35 that included a 
tanker truck driving toward protesters
 and then ended with amicable arrests at the Bobby and Steve’s Auto World on S. Washington.

“By Monday, June 1, the crowds and violent behavior subsided, while largely peaceful protests persisted with minimal arrests,” Wilder concluded.

The Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) is making its case to not only extend by time, but also expand its use of ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection technology, to more of the city’s neighborhoods.
Though the city’s law enforcement officials say the technology is vital to their public safety efforts, some council members have raised concerns about its effectiveness, prompting negotiations over how long and how far the technology should reach in Minneapolis.
MPD’s case for ShotSpotter 
ShotSpotter, now known as SoundThinking Inc., is a gunshot detection system used by more than 160 cities nationwide that installs sensors and microphones in locations around a city that are hidden from both police and the public. Through the combination of a machine-learning algorithm and human evaluators, the system detects gunshots and relays the location where a sensor went off to local police.
 


 


During an Administrative and Enterprise and Oversight Committee meeting earlier this month, Office of Community Safety (OCS) Commissioner Todd Barnette and MPD Chief Brian O’Hara gave a presentation on how ShotSpotter is used in Minneapolis and how it helps officers do their jobs. 
Commissioner Todd Barnette
“ShotSpotter does save lives,” Barnette said at the start of the presentation, likening the technology to a smoke detector in a home.

Barnette said the technology allows for a 911 dispatcher to receive a notification less than 60 seconds of a sensor’s activation, allowing officers – who get text messages whenever a ShotSpotter sensor is activated – to react and respond to that location faster. That then allows officers to get to victims faster, facilitates more efficient collection of gunfire data and aids in the collection of evidence, he said. 
ShotSpotter currently covers seven square miles – a large chunk of north Minneapolis neighborhoods and a smaller area in south Minneapolis – which is about 12% of the city. According to OCS data, 56% of gunshot wound victims between 2021 and 2023 were found within the areas where ShotSpotter has coverage.
 


 


O’Hara stressed the importance of the technology in its helpfulness in the department’s investigative efforts, citing multiple incidents that led to arrests for murder after the sensors directed officers to the shots’ locations, where they were able to recover bullet casings and DNA evidence. 
MPD Chief Brian O’Hara
“This is a tool,” O’Hara said. “By being able to determine a location of where a shooting actually happened, that can get us much quicker into the right area to start talking to people, start looking for people and hopefully recover ballistic evidence … that can trace what gun that was that fired the shots.”
The proposed contract would include an extension through March 2027, and a westward expansion of the technology into the Uptown neighborhoods of south Minneapolis, including Whittier, Loring Park and Lyn-Lake.

The presentation countered 
a series of presentations given to the committee in April
 by researchers at the University of Minnesota Law School and Legal Rights Center, as well as Campaign Zero, a public safety-focused research group. Their findings showed that ShotSpotter routinely activated in error, lengthened 911 response times and disproportionately impacted the city’s Black and Native residents, resulting in over-policing of those communities.
 


 


Future of contract
During the same committee meeting earlier this month, city staff presented a report commissioned by Ward 2 Council Member Robin Wonsley, the committee’s chair, along with Ward 5 Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, to identify potential third-party contractors who can come in and evaluate the ShotSpotter program and produce data that can be used to determine whether the program is effective or not. 
“Our whole thing was that we want to make sure the Council has information and objective data to have access to prior to considering an extension of the contract,” Wonsley said in an interview. 
The city currently pays just more than $233,000 for its ShotSpotter coverage. The initial proposed contract extension is expected to cost an additional $575,000 per year to maintain the city’s existing coverage zones, and the expansion to Uptown would add another $407,000.

Wonsley and Ellison met with Barnette and other public safety officials last week to express their concerns about the extension and expansion of the ShotSpotter contract. Wonsley said Barnette and OCS are taking their concerns into consideration and amending the contract, which could involve shortening the extension to 2026 or limiting the expansion from two square miles to 0.6 square miles, or both. 
 


 


The amended contract is then expected to come before the committee during their next meeting on Sept 9. 
“It’s very typical when there are concerns that are brought up by council members to reach out to the administration with those concerns directly and see if there’s a pathway forward for any corrective actions to be taken,” Wonsley said. “In this case, there was agreeable interest in finding something that could be of support amongst the Council and that is what’s being brought forward, hopefully, on Sept. 9.”

This story originally ran on the 
Energy News Network
.
Construction is underway in St. Paul on a major affordable housing development that will combine solar, geothermal and all-electric appliances to create one of the region’s largest net-zero communities.
Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity broke ground in June on a four-block, 147-unit project on the site of a former golf course that’s being redeveloped by the city and its port authority, which made the decision to forgo gas hookups. 
 


 


Affordable housing and 
Habitat for Humanity builds in particular
 have become a front line in the fight over the future of gas. The organization has faced criticism in other communities for accepting fossil fuel industry money and partnering with utilities on “net-zero” homes that include gas appliances. It’s also built several all-electric projects using advanced sustainable construction methods and materials.
The scale of the Twin Cities project is what makes it exciting, according to St. Paul’s chief resilience officer Russ Stark. 
“We’ve had plenty of motivated folks build their own all-electric homes, but they’re one-offs,” he said. “There haven’t been many, if any, at scale.”
Stark added that the project, known as The Heights, was made possible by the federal Inflation Reduction Act. 
 


 


“I think it’s fair to say that those pieces couldn’t have all come together without either a much bigger public investment or the Inflation Reduction Act, which ended up being that big public investment,” he said.
A vision emerges
Port Authority President and CEO Todd Hurley said his organization bought the property in 2019 from the Steamfitters Pipefitters Local 455, which maintained it as a golf course until 2017. When no private buyers expressed interest in the property, the Port Authority bought it for $10 million.

Hurley said the Port Authority saw potential for light industrial development and had the experience necessary to deal with mercury pollution from a fungicide the golf course staff sprayed to kill weeds.
“We are a land developer, a brownfield land developer, and one of our missions is to add jobs and tax base around the creation of light industrial jobs,” Hurley said.
 


 


The Port Authority worked with the city’s planning department on a master plan that included housing, and it solicited developers to build a mix of market-rate, affordable and low-income units. The housing parcels were eventually sold for $20 million to a private developer, Sherman Associates, which partnered with Habitat and JO Companies, a Black-owned affordable and multi-family housing developer.
“Early on, we identified a very high goal of (becoming) a net zero community,” Hurley said. “Everything we have been working on has been steering towards getting to net zero.”
Twin Cities Habitat President and former St. Paul mayor Chris Coleman said the project met his organization’s strategic plan, which calls for building bigger developments instead of its traditional practice of infilling smaller lots with single-family homes and duplexes. The project will be the largest the organization has ever built in the Twin Cities.
Coleman said the Heights offered an opportunity to fill a need in one of St. Paul’s most diverse and economically challenged neighborhoods and “be part of the biggest investment in the East Side in over 100 years.”
 


 


The requirement for all-electric homes merged with Habitat’s goal of constructing more efficient and sustainable homes to drive down utility costs for homeowners, he said. Habitat built solar-ready homes and sees the solar shingles on its homes in The Heights as a potential avenue to producing onsite clean energy.
Zeroing in on net zero
Mike Robertson, a Habitat program manager working on the project, said the organization worked with teams from the Minneapolis-based Center for Energy and Environment on energy modeling.
“The Heights is the first time that we’ve dived into doing an all-electric at scale,” Roberston said. “We have confidence that these houses will perform how they were modeled.”
Habitat plans to build the development to meet the Zero Energy Ready Home Program standards developed by the U.S. Department of Energy. Habitat will use Xcel Energy’s utility rebate and efficiency programs to achieve the highest efficiency and go above and beyond Habitat’s typical home standards.
 


 


The improved construction only adds a few thousand dollars to the overall costs and unlocks federal government incentives to help pay for upgrades, he said.
The nonprofit will receive free or reduced-cost products from Andersen Windows & Doors and other manufacturers. GAF Energy LLC, a solar roofing company, will donate solar shingles for over 40 homes and roofing materials. On-site solar will help bring down energy bills for homeowners, he said.
Chad Dipman, Habitat land development director, said the solar shingles should cover between half and 60% of the electricity the homes need. Habitat plans to use Xcel Energy incentive programs to help pay for additional solar shingles needed beyond those donated. 
Habitat will install electric resistance heating technology into air handlers to serve as backup heat for extremely cold days. Dipman said that the air source heat pumps will also provide air conditioning, a feature not available in most Habitat properties in Minnesota.  
Phil Anderson, new homes manager at the Center for Energy and Environment, has worked with Habitat on the project. He said the key to reducing the cost of heating and cooling electric homes is a well-insulated, tight envelope and high-performance windows. Habitat will build on its experience with constructing tight homes over the past decade, he said.
“Overall, the houses that we’ve been part of over the last almost ten years have been very tight homes,” Anderson said. “There’s just not a lot of air escaping.”
Habitat’s national office selected The Heights as this year’s 
Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project
, named after the former president and his wife, two of Habitat’s most famous supporters. The work project begins September 29
th
 and will receive as visitors Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, who now host the Carters’ program.
Robertson said thousands of volunteers from around the country and the world will help put up the homes. The Heights project “raises a lot of awareness for Habitat and specifically for this development and the decarbonization efforts that we’re putting into it,” he said.
The Heights’s two other housing developers continue raising capital for their projects and hope to break ground by next summer. Habitat believes the project will meet its 2030 completion deadline.

When it comes to dating, yes means yes, no means no, and no action probably means they ghosted you for one reason or another and you should move on. 
However, different rules apply to the Met Council and their light rail projects, as well as highways being planned by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. For example, this fall, the Met Council will give cities a statute-mandated opportunity to say “yes” or “no” to the Blue Line Extension project’s engineering design. 
But instead of no meaning “no,” no means “they have to say the conditions to get approval,” Hennepin County spokesperson Kyle Mianulli said in an interview after the Aug. 8 Blue Line Extension Corridor Management Committee meeting. 
 


 


And cities can’t ghost the Met Council, because if they do, they’re consenting to the project. It’s why Ward 5 Minneapolis City Council member Jeremiah Ellison intends to vote to grant municipal consent on the project. 
“If municipal consent isn’t passed, then the project can still move forward. We probably create some complications, but then the city’s voice at that point is essentially moot. They’re gonna go around you, they’re gonna take those other avenues, they’re gonna get their approvals elsewhere and it’s never coming back before you,” Ellison said in an interview after the same Corridor Management Committee meeting.
County and Met Council officials say the municipal consent process is more of an opportunity for cities to formally share their feedback on how the project should be designed, and that they will work with local communities on a solution. They add it’s not an opportunity to ask for things outside the scope of the design, such as rebuilding an adjacent county road and asking for the project to instead be a bus rapid transit line.
What is municipal consent and why ask for it now? 
State statute
 requires that the Metropolitan Council present their engineering drawings for light rail projects to cities, counties, and/or townships for approval. The communities then have at least 30 days to hold a public hearing, and 45 days after the hearing date to decide whether to formally approve the project via resolution, informally approve the project by not taking a vote, or disapprove of the project. 
 


 


Statute does not provide communities a way to approve engineering drawings with conditions; they can only do so through disapproval. Through the disapproval process, communities have to provide conditions project planners would have to meet to gain their approval. The Met Council will then convene a hearing to understand the changes and decide what about the plans will change within 60 days of the communities’ hearing. If the plans change in conformance with what the communities ask for, planners don’t have to return with revised plans for consent. 
Highway projects have a similar process
. However, since the Minnesota Department of Transportation does not have a board, any appeal of highway design plans must go before a three-member board appointed by the dissenting community, MnDOT, and one either mutually agreed to by MnDOT and the community, or the chief justice of the Supreme Court. 
Blue Line Extension planners are seeking municipal consent now, after years of planning, so they can conduct environmental review on any changes that the communities want made. The plans are currently at 30% design, which means they have an idea of where the alignment and stations will be, but not detailed plans for the stations and the surrounding intersections. 
“Some of the outcomes of municipal consent might need to change the environmental document. They may ask for something, we’d have to study that in the environmental document before it could be finalized,” deputy general manager Nick Thompson said shortly after presenting at a July 9 city of Minneapolis’ Intergovernmental Relations Committee.

The county and the Met Council already delayed the municipal consent process by about six to eight months. Project planners needed to change the alignment to not run on Lyndale Avenue North because neighbors there 
vociferously
 
opposed
 
it
. “That would not have made it through municipal consent in Minneapolis,” said Dan Soler, transit and mobility director for Hennepin County.
It’s possible communities may have to vote on municipal consent more than once. This happened with the 
Southwest Light Rail project
, when planners redesigned it 
to reduce costs by $250 million
. 
Changes possible, within reason 
Comments cities submitted as part of the 
environmental review
 process may hint at what cities plan to ask for as part of the municipal consent process. For example, a letter the Minneapolis City Council voted to submit in July calls for adding a light rail station at Washington and West Broadway. Both the city and council member Ellison say the light rail station would connect Northside residents with destinations that they have a hard time reaching, which include parks, bars, restaurants, job centers, and the Mississippi River.
“Connectivity from north Minneapolis to the river specifically matters to us and my community where, you see, we’ve had the North Side be cut off from the river and other parts of the city with the 94 trench being there, with the 394 cutting off a lot of north Minneapolis from other parts of the city. We feel a little bit on an island, and we want more points of connectivity along the way,” Ellison said. 
 


 


The process does not allow cities to ask for changes deemed outside of the scope of the project’s current design. For example, cities would not be able to ask for the project to study bus rapid transit instead. “We’re asking them about whether they support the current design, which is a light rail transit project,” Thompson said. 
“BRT would be a whole different project. We’ve been advancing a light rail project, and so you can’t just take this rail project and make it a BRT,” Mianulli added. Changing the project could endanger the agency’s ability to obtain federal funds for the corridor. 
Cities also would not be able to ask for road improvements the Met Council deems to be outside of the corridor, though they may be able to ask for it as an environmental impact mitigation measure. The cities of Robbinsdale and 
Crystal
 are concerned about traffic spilling over from Bottineau Boulevard over to West Broadway between Douglas Drive and 42nd Avenue, as county and Met Council planners aim to reduce the lanes on Bottineau from six to four. 
Crystal city officials want Hennepin County to rebuild West Broadway between Douglas Drive and the city limits so the road can handle any traffic spillover. “Their own regional forecast model shows 1,000 vehicles per day shift by 2040 from Bottineau to Broadway. It should be obvious that reducing the number of lanes on Bottineau is going to increase that shift, exacerbate that shift,” John Sutter, Crystal’s community development director, said in a phone interview. 
 


 


County transportation planners don’t plan to rebuild West Broadway between Douglas and 42nd to mitigate any impacts caused by construction of the Blue Line extension. They believe traffic will continue to flow at, in Soler’s words, “an adequate level of service,” which wouldn’t call for mitigation. 
Cities and the general public would also not be able to ask for conditions to address anti-displacement, because it does not pertain to the project’s design. Hennepin County on Monday released a guide to 
implement the Blue Line Extension’s anti-displacement recommendations
.
All four cities, as well as Hennepin County, plan to hold 
hearings
 to hear from their residents what they should consider for municipal consent in the coming weeks. The communities will then vote whether or not to grant municipal consent before Oct. 10.
How has municipal consent played out in the past?
To date, no city has formally dissented over proposals to build light rail in the Twin Cities. Every city along the Southwest Light Rail project approved plans for light rail in their communities. 
 


 


Although cities provided nonbinding conditions as a part of approval, project officials say they still worked with communities on those conditions. For example: St. Louis Park’s resolution to provide 
municipal consent
 included a condition to reconstruct the Cedar Lake Regional Trail at two city intersections so they don’t intersect. The trail, which is now grade-separated because it passes under both streets through a tunnel, reopened in July. And Eden Prairie’s 
resolution
 called for the Prairie Center Drive viaduct to be designed such that it “complements” the experience around Purgatory Creek Park and the Veterans’ Memorial; indeed, the viaducts have carvings of the wildlife found at the nearby creek. 
For the first iteration of the Blue Line Extension, the Crystal City Council in February 2016 passed a resolution neither approving nor disapproving the project’s design. One of the concerns the city had at the time was the 
lack of a
 bridge for people walking and biking across Bottineau Boulevard at Bass Lake Road. The project’s current iteration calls for building an interchange, where people walking and biking would only interact with traffic turning onto or off of Bottineau Boulevard. 
Meanwhile, cities have successfully used the consent process to force changes to highway projects. In 2004, the 
city of Minneapolis voted to deny consent
 to MnDOT to rebuild 
Interstate 35W between 42nd and 66th
 Streets, and Highway 62 from Penn to Portland Avenues. They said MnDOT’s plans relied on freeway expansion instead of improving transit. The appeals board affirmed the city’s denial, and MnDOT changed their plans to build a bus station at 46th Street, which opened in 2010. 
Technically, the Met Council does not need to seek municipal consent for bus rapid transit projects because such a process is not outlined in state statute. The Met Council nonetheless has heeded the wishes of cities that do not want to see bus rapid transit in their communities, such as White Bear Lake, 
which passed a resolution in 2022 opposing the project
. 
Parks departments don’t have an official say, so how do they get heard?
While cities are part of municipal consent, government entities that focus on managing parks, like the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board, do not. Still, they have influence on the process assuming they’re engaged with the cities that do have an official say.
The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board on Aug. 7 voted 6-1 to oppose a Blue Line Extension route that crosses Victory and Theodore Wirth Parkways at grade; both parkways straddle the Minneapolis and Robbinsdale city limits, and both cities are taking note of the park board’s concerns.

Minneapolis City Council member LaTrisha Vetaw said at the July 9 Intergovernmental Relations Committee meeting that she would like to see the Blue Line Extension cross the parkways underground. During a phone interview, however, Park Board Commissioner Becka Thompson, who represents the area and drafted the 
park board’s letter
, isn’t so sure, but agrees that the route should not cross the parkways at grade. 
“If you put it underground, it’d be safe and it’d be great. But I get that literally adds a billion dollars to the price tag,” Thompson said during the phone interview. Both Thompson and Vetaw also want a proposed station there to be moved away from Lowry Avenue.
The Met Council previously proposed building a station on a viaduct, to be connected directly to a ramp that connects with North Memorial Hospital. The park board and North Memorial Hospital cried foul, which resulted in the Met Council proposing an at-grade option. But with the park board’s latest opposition, deputy general manager Nick Thompson says they plan to respond to the park board’s concerns as part of the environmental review process. 
The Minneapolis park board also had concerns with the Southwest Light Rail extension crossing Cedar Lake Parkway. “This situation is very similar to what happened during the initial designs of the SWLRT through the Kenilworth channel. Except in that process, we took more of a lead role. For the Blue Line, we will be involved in the process, but not in a lead role,” spokesperson Robin Smothers said.
Meanwhile, the Three Rivers Park District was able to work with Hennepin County, the Met Council, and local cities to grade-separate the Cedar Lake Regional Trail at Belt Line Boulevard, Wooddale Avenue, and Blake Road as part of the Southwest Light Rail project. The trail reopened in July, the occasion marked by a 50-person bike ride led by Chair Charlie Zelle and project manager Jim Alexander earlier this month.

“They’ve had us at the table for both projects from the early days on and they’ve been good to work with, and the cities have been great partners on this. Those three streets have heavy road traffic, and the trail traffic was quite heavy before the LRT started. All parties agreed that, in the best interest of the trail users, to have great separated crossings,” said Jonathan Vlaming, associate superintendent of planning, design and technology at Three Rivers Park District.

In 2018, a Somali man who had just moved to Minneapolis was navigating the unfamiliar roads of the city’s northside when he mistakenly turned the wrong way down a one way street. A Minneapolis Police officer pulled him over and the encounter ended with the man, who couldn’t explain himself because he didn’t know English, being charged with driving while intoxicated. 
The problem? The man, a devout Muslim, had never consumed alcohol. Six years later, the mistake has cost him thousands in lawyer fees and missed work opportunities that would have gone to supporting himself and his family.
“I couldn’t drive Uber or Lyft or a taxi and I’ve never touched a drop (of alcohol) in my life,” the man, who MinnPost is not identifying due to privacy concerns, said in Somali. “Because I don’t know the language, I don’t speak English, the police took advantage of me.”
 


 


Language barriers have long been an issue in relations between law enforcement and the communities they serve, manifesting in fear of calling 911 or miscommunication that would further escalate high stakes situations. As ranks of sworn officers become more diverse to reflect the communities they police and translation technology is more widely available, law enforcement officials say those barriers are getting easier to overcome.

According to the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) Policy and Procedure Manual, if officers come across someone who can’t speak English, they are required to inform them that language assistance services exist free of charge and offer those services to them. The department does have a Limited English Proficiency Coordinator, according to the manual, whose duty is to ensure access to those services and train officers on when and how to use them.

Language identification cards are used by the department to determine what language a person speaks, and the city offers a language line for questions about city services.
MPD did not provide answers to questions about how often language access services are deployed and whether those interactions are tracked.
 


 


There have been many instances where miscommunication due to a language barrier has escalated a situation, said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Hussein said he had one client who couldn’t explain himself to the officer who stopped him after making a mistake in traffic and immediately ended up in the back of a squad car. 
“Does it increase the discretion and the potential targeting and more likely that violation? Yes it does,” he said. “In this case, they put him in the back of the car and then they searched his car and he didn’t know why they were searching the car, especially for just going the wrong way.”
 


 


Brian Higgins, former Bergen County Police Chief in New Jersey and current lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, echoed Hussein, citing the killing of Amadou Diallo by New York Police Department officers in 1999, when the officers shot and killed the 23-year-old Guinean student for reaching for his wallet.
It’s much easier now to overcome a possible language barrier between members of the public and law enforcement than it was in the past. One reason is police forces are now much more diverse and more likely to have sworn officers with the same cultural backgrounds that make up parts of the communities they police. 
 


 


“There’s been this effort to make law enforcement agencies look more like their communities,” Higgins said. “And it’s not necessarily just so they physically look like them, but it’s so as an agency you understand people’s cultures and can speak to them in their language.”
The other factor, he said, is the improvement in technology. In place of having someone physically come to where an officer has someone stopped, officers now have the options of placing a call to a translating agency or using an app that each can quickly provide real-time translations without delay.
In addition to more diversity within law enforcement agencies and gains in technology, there have been more concerted efforts to overcome language barriers. In late 2022, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division launched a Law Enforcement Language Access Initiative in an effort to ensure that law enforcement were providing language assistance to residents with limited English proficiency.

These improvements may be reflected in police departments in cities and metro areas, but rural areas are progressing in this regard at a much slower rate, Hussein said. He said a robust public awareness campaign aimed toward immigrants and others with limited English language skills, along with anti-bias training for officers, are a must for improvement. 
Higgins said the solution to this issue will be the combination of all of those.
“Law enforcement is public safety, so anything we can do to provide services to the public, I think we should try,” he said. “You have to try all of those avenues to make sure law enforcement is just that – serving the community.”

If you want to understand how much an electorate can shift over a short couple of years, look no further than Tuesday’s primary election between Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels. 
Omar, a “squad” member in Congress who has been critical of Israel, was nearly ousted from the November ballot in the 2022 primary, eking out a narrow, 2-percentage-point victory over Samuels in the 5th Congressional District. In the same race this year, Omar beat Samuels by more than 13 percentage points. 
How did that happen? 
 


 


Many factors could be considered in this, said Corey Day, former executive director of the Minnesota DFL and owner of local political consulting firm Blue Ox Strategies. First and foremost, Omar put a lot more energy and focus in this race than she did in the last, he said. Not only did Omar’s campaign funnel 
far more money into the race
, Omar raised more than $6.6 million in campaign cash and Samuels raised more than $1.4 million. 
Groups supporting Omar also independently spent nearly $550,000 to boost her campaign, according to a MinnPost analysis of Federal Election Commission records. Additionally, Make a Difference Minnesota, an organization connected to an AIPAC political action committee, spent $110,000 in support of Samuels and mailed out flyers attacking Omar.

In addition to spending more money on her campaign, Omar also gave more attention to a range of areas in her district this year, including those she hadn’t spent as much time in in the past, Day said.

“A more well-rounded campaign was brought this time,” Day said. “I think what you saw this time was Ilhan was just someone with popularity in this district. Even if she might be polarizing to some nationally, she still has an extremely strong base.” 
Overall, the issues that are top of mind for voters have also changed. In 2022, Samuels was running heavily on public safety.

“Two years ago, I think you had more of an opportunity for that because of what was going on issue-wise around the city,” Day said. 
It had only been two years since George Floyd’s murder sparked calls among several Minneapolis City Council members to defund the police, and 
Omar defended that view
 and also 
endorsed an effort
 to amend the city’s charter and replace the police department with a public safety department. Later, though, she broke with other “Squad” members to 
vote in favor of a compromise police funding bill
 in the House.
 


 


Still, the public safety debate that took center stage in the 2022 Omar-Samuels primary seemed to reflect a political divide seen largely at the city level within Minneapolis between more and less progressive members of the council. This time around, however, that divide didn’t seem to bleed into the congressional race as much, with Omar earning more votes than Samuels in all but one Minneapolis City Council ward and increasing her margin of victory in many precincts.  
 


 


There wasn’t enough difference between the 2022 primary and this year’s for people to get excited about it, said Annette Meeks, who worked for decades in Republican politics both in Minnesota and Washington, D.C. She also lived in the 5th Congressional District in 2022 but has since moved. “Crime was an enormous top-of-mind topic back in 2022; now it isn’t so much,” she said. 
“People generally think: if you’re close you should run again,” she said. “Sometimes that’s true. But generally when you’re running against an incumbent – it’s because people wanted to fire her from her job in Congress. That just wasn’t there this time.” 
In lieu of a local debate over public safety, the war between Israel and Hamas prevailed as a top issue addressed by candidates this year. In 2022, the Samuels campaign received support from the American Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC), whose PAC gave $350,000 to an organization that ran independent ads against Omar in the last contest between Samuels and the congresswoman two years ago. But AIPAC did not intervene in this race, preferring instead to concentrate its efforts and resources to knocking off two other “Squad” members, Democratic U.S. Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri and Jamaal Bowman of New York.
 


 


In 2022, Samuels represented an alternative option to many who felt left behind by Omar, Samuels said at his watch party Tuesday night. 
This year, the energy between watch parties was night and day. Samuels had a far smaller turnout, while the crowd at Nighthawks in Minneapolis cheering for Omar could be heard outside on the street. 
In 2022, locals knocked on doors and nearly clinched a Samuels primary win. That enthusiasm inspired John Isen of San Francisco to travel to California this week to help Samuels get out the vote. 
“I was looking for a race I thought would be close,” Isen said, noting the close run Samuels had in 2022. “I was looking for a cause. I was looking for a cause, an issue, something to be involved in.” 
 


 


Isen watched excitedly as Samuels entered the primary night watch party at Canopy by Hilton in downtown Minneapolis. But once the results rolled in, those hoping a second time would push their candidate over the edge were disappointed. 
Samuels hasn’t said whether he would try to challenge Omar again, but in his post-primary statement said that despite the loss, “the results show that people are hungry for a different approach.”
This story has been updated to reflect that The Make a Difference Minnesota PAC spent about $110,000, not $30,000 on flyers attacking Omar.

When Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty was in her tenure as a public defender she noticed a disturbing trend.
According to the now top prosecutor in the county, time after time, many of her defendants, often Black, were facing almost all white juries. 
“I had one case where a client (who was Black) was offered a (plea) deal that he declined, but when he saw the jury he asked, ‘Is that deal still available,'” said Moriarty in an interview with MinnPost following the 
vacated sentence of Marvin Haynes
, convicted in 2005 for the murder of a Minneapolis flower shop owner. 
 


 


The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the accused an impartial jury of their peers. But data from the Minnesota court system showing racial disparities in the selection of jurors for trials across the metro area over the past 10 years has put that guarantee in doubt. 
In response to increasing concerns about a lack of representation in jury makeups, public defenders and criminal defense attorneys across the state have filed demands for representative juries, though solutions to the issue remain far from concrete. 
Disparities in jury makeups and defendants across the metro
According to data obtained from the state court system, white residents of Hennepin County – which includes Minneapolis and is the most populous county in the state – were more likely to be selected to take part in a jury trial when compared to their share of the county’s population. White residents made up between 82% and 84% of all juries for trials between 2013 and 2022, though they make up about 73% of the county’s population. 
The opposite was true for the county’s Black residents. Despite making up more than 14% of the county’s population, Black residents made up only 7% to 8% of juries between 2013 and 2019. That number declined even further in recent years, dipping to 6% in 2020 and again to just 5% in 2021. 
 


 


Every other racial demographic group in Hennepin County, including Asian and Native American residents, were also underrepresented in juries over that 10-year period.
Similar patterns existed in Ramsey County, the next most populous county in Minnesota. White residents make up about 65% of the county’s population, but 75% of the jurors selected for trials in 2022. Every other racial demographic group was underrepresented compared to their population, as was the case in Hennepin, but some groups saw changes to that figure over time.

The amount Black residents in the county who were selected to be on a jury has remained stagnant since 2013, hovering around 6%, compared to a population of more than 13% countywide. But Asian residents – who make up a substantial portion of the county’s population at almost 16% – saw gains in representation on juries, going from just under 7% in 2013 to more than 11% in 2022. 
Despite being underrepresented on juries, Black residents of Minnesota’s two largest counties were overrepresented as defendants. 
 


 


According to data from the state court system showing the racial breakdown of of defendants in adult criminal cases with a jury trial hearing held between 2013 and 2023, Black individual in Hennepin County made up more than half of all defendants each year, hovering between 53% and 61% during that time frame, except for a spike to 64% in 2020 and a dip to 49% in 2022. That is around four times their share of the county’s population, while white defendants were between 14% and 23% during the same period.
In Ramsey County, during the same time frame, Black individuals accounted for between 39% and 53% of all defendants, excluding a spike to 64% in 2021. The number of white individuals that were defendants was similar to Black residents early in the decade, with 37% in 2013 and 38% in 2014, but saw a gradual decline over the decade to 21% in 2022 and just 18% in 2023.
The five remaining counties that make up the Twin Cities metro area – Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Scott and Washington – all exhibited the same disparities, though at a smaller scale due to smaller populations.  
Finding the cause
The way the jury system is organized is the state court system contracts with a company called Jury Systems Incorporated, which compiles various source lists that include registered voter rolls from the Secretary of State’s office, and drivers licenses and state IDs from the Department of Motor Vehicles. The company then cross-references with death records and mailing lists from the U.S. Postal Service to create a composite list, which is then divided into the various judicial districts and distributed to local jury offices. 
 


 


From there, the local jury office does the math on how many jurors will be needed for a given week of trials, randomly selects a certain number of prospective jurors and sends out summonses in the mail, sending out extra in anticipation of non-responses. That results in a pool of about 250 people, of which 25-30 people are then randomly selected for each trial. 
“The lack of representativeness occurs before they even get there on Monday for the most part,” said Emmett Donnelly, a Hennepin County public defender with a 35-year career. 
 


 


When the 25 to 30 prospective jurors show up to fill the spots on the jury – six for a misdemeanor trial and 12 for a felony trial, plus an alternate or two, respectively – attorneys receive information on each of them beforehand that includes race, gender, age and occupation, and both sides question the candidates. The prosecution gets three strikes to use to dismiss juror candidates while the defense gets five, though strikes for cause – like a conflict of interest – are unlimited. 
Criminal defense attorney Mohammed El-Bashir said that in his experience, it’s very unlikely that race plays enough of a role in the paneling process. The strategy for attorneys changes with each case, depending heavily on the types of charges. 
 


 


Due to the lack of information provided ahead of time via the juror profiles, attorneys may make broad generalizations based on what might benefit their client. For example, in a self-defense case, the defense may want to panel a man with a family who may see himself in that kind of situation, or prosecutors may want to panel more women if they’re trying a sexual assault case.

“You're kind of picking like six or seven different judges for your person,” El-Bashir said. “You just want an idea of whether this person is going to be receptive to my arguments or not.”
But, he said, using strikes based on race is unheard of for either the prosecution or the defense. 
“At the end of the day, it's very frowned upon,” El-Bashir said. “I would be really surprised if there's prosecutors purely striking people based off of that.”
Future and solutions 
Hundreds of filings from public defenders and criminal defense attorneys demanding more representation on juries were heard in December 2022. A month later, Hennepin County District Judge John Lucas issued an order that was a call to action for the court system at large to find a remedy to the issue. 
Donnelly is among the attorneys leading the way on litigating on the issue trying to help improve the way the system works. One main fix that Donnelly said he sees is to update how the pools of prospective jurors are assembled. The problem with using voter rolls and lists from the DMV is that they’re both lists that aren’t updated very often, he said. 
“How often is your address updated when you register in the voter rolls? Only time will be is if you actually go to vote,” Donnelly said. “And with driver’s licenses, if you change addresses you're supposed to notify them but how many people do, and who would be the class of people that would be more likely to do that and have the ability to do that?”
The solution? Adding state tax return data to the list used to assemble potential jurors. Donnelly said this would fix issues with how current the list is because everyone is required to file a tax return every year and each time someone files they provide a current address. 
Another is to improve juror compensation, which has remained at $20 per day, but for many, most of that is spent on parking alone. 
Donnelly said the biggest immediate effect of these disparities is on the jurors themselves, and their feelings of whether they were able to honestly and objectively judge a case without an array of voices in the deliberation room. The other effect, he said, is on the public. 
“When (people) look at an all-white jury convicting a Black person or a nonwhite person, people tend to scratch your head and question the legitimacy of that,” he said.

For some drivers, parking is critical, especially when it’s near their home. It’s even more critical to those who don’t want to drive to work, like Loring Park resident Ben Bockover. 
“If I could leave my car here, if there weren’t hours where I’d have to move it, I’d bike,” Bockover said of his commute to his job on Lyndale Avenue, while walking to his car to go grocery shopping. 
On some blocks in Loring Park, people either have to move their vehicles every so often between the hours of 9 a.m. and  4 p.m. on weekdays, or spring for a $25 annual permit to park on some blocks for as long as 72 hours. These blocks are part of what are called Critical Parking Areas, and the zones may soon change as the city of Minneapolis works to get people biking, walking, and taking transit more. 
 


 


Changes begin in Cedar-Riverside
The Minneapolis City Council approved the 
first of three rounds
 of changes to its so-called Critical Parking Areas on Aug. 1. The changes affect zones in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood by: 
Eliminating some critical parking spots and allows anyone to park there for free,


Converting critical parking spots into metered spaces, meaning anyone parking there would have to pay, or


Changing critical parking spots so that only those with a critical parking permit can park there.
City spokesperson Allen Henry said the project is in response to significant development and land use changes in the city over the past couple of decades. “The restrictions are no longer relevant in several cases,” Henry said. 
The city also is making changes to critical parking areas to get people to walk, bike, and take public transit more often. The city’s goal is for 60% of all travel to occur without a car by 2030. 
Later this year, the city plans to implement changes to zones in Loring and Elliot Park, neighborhoods just south of downtown Minneapolis. The city is still researching potential changes. A presentation for the Minneapolis City Council says the days and hours of when a vehicle would be required to have a permit to park could change, or the zones could be eliminated entirely. From there, the city could either install meters or let any vehicle park for free. After they make changes to Loring and Elliot Park, they plan to finalize changes citywide by next year.

History of critical parking
The Critical Parking program was established in 1976 at a time when cities across the nation were trying to address 
suburban commuters parking in residential neighborhoods
. The first two zones were created in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, after residents 
voiced frustration
 with competing for parking with students and hospital workers. These same two zones are being modified by the city today. 
The zones are established by resident petition. A resident has to collect signatures from 75% of residences in an area that they wish to designate as a critical parking area. After the city conducts a 
parking study
, staff present the designation of such a zone before the City Council for approval. 
Permits for these zones started at $7 when the program was created in 1976, with a $2 annual renewal fee. Since 2004, permits have cost $25 annually. About 2,100 vehicles have a permit to park in a critical parking area, out of around 2,500 eligible residences. 
Parking critical for livelihoods
In its presentation, the city said Augsburg University is a supporter of plans to make changes to how critical parking areas work around campus because permit holders often can’t find spaces. They include restricting on-street parking spaces around campus to only those who have permits, as well as converting the rest of the spaces to metered parking. Augsburg University administration says they are allotted 75 permits for their students to use. 
 


 


But Augsburg University spokesperson Rachel Farris says the university has not offered support of the plan. 
“Augsburg was not asked to approve or support a set of proposed changes to city parking on campus and around Murphy Square Park, but did provide feedback to the city traffic and parking services department related to parking availability, parking spot turnover, and snow clearance under the plan,” Farris said. 
Meanwhile, the executive directors of both the Loring and Elliot Park neighborhood associations say the city has not contacted them to discuss proposed changes to their critical parking areas. 
 


 


“We seem to have some real difficulty getting timely notices from public works, if at all. It’s hard to understand since residents and businesses here are the taxpayers and paying for these projects,” said Jana Metge, executive director of Citizens for a Loring Park Community. 
 


 


The city plans to conduct engagement “after the proposed changes are determined,” Henry said. 
Nonetheless, residents in both Loring and Elliot Park are not happy about the prospect of existing critical parking zones being converted into metered zones. 
“We have chosen to park in metered zones before, but primarily that causes a lot of stress. Those spots, you have to wake up early and either move your car or pay the meter or risk getting towed. And I’ve already gotten one citation on my windshield before because I was trying to park somewhere and my time expired before I woke up,” Loring Park resident Cassandra Hagen said while walking on the street, adding she is struggling to make ends meet with her wages. Hagen uses her car to get to work downtown, as well as to visit family in Cook, Minnesota. 
She thought about buying a bike, but can’t afford to do so because she has to pay to maintain and insure her car. She also considered taking the bus to and from work, but she’s worried about how she would get home after her shift at night, especially during the winter. “Being in downtown, like an urban setting, I’ve seen at my job (that) we deal with a lot of stuff because of that urban setting, unfortunately, and it’s very tough, but that makes me more wary of public transportation, especially because it’s not something I grew up knowing how to use,” Hagen said, adding she is willing to learn how to use public transit. 
 


 


Safety concerns are also what prompted Elliot Park resident Mellie Salas to drive to get around. She experienced harassment while being out and about. 
“I’ve always had men come up to me the minute they see me alone. It’s best to have a car to feel safe out and about,” Salas said as she moved her belongings from a car that doesn’t work to another car she just bought. She also doesn’t think parking spots that are part of the Elliot Park critical parking area, designated ahead of the 1982 opening of the now-demolished Metrodome, should remain as they are today. 
Salas also needs a car because she does not feel safe biking and walking in the winter. 
“It’s not safe to bike and walk in the winter because of the snow. They don’t even plow the sidewalks or the streets and sometimes it gets too cold to walk,” Salas said. 
As challenging as it is for her to drive in the city, Hagen would rather stick to that form of commuting. 
“It’s just much easier to say I’ll just drive my car that I’ve spent so much money and time on than to take public transportation, which would cost extra couple dollars, or an extra $120 to get a bicycle,” Hagen said.

What does a police contract and a convention center renovation have in common?
Well, not a lot. But in Minneapolis’ case, both became linked during Minneapolis City Council funding discussions over the last month. And the discussion is noteworthy because it demonstrated how the council’s progressive majority sometimes clashes with council veterans on process.
Here’s what happened:
 


 


The City Council passed 
the police contract and its funding on July 18
 in a motion that originally included the passage of around 
$13 million in funding for the second phase of a convention center remodel
. 
At the time, many council members insisted both the police contract funding and the funding for the convention center needed to remain in the same act. Ultimately, the council passed the police contract funding plan in front of them that day but sent the convention center bid back to committee. This bid was later passed at the Aug. 1 council meeting.

So why were council members insisting the two things needed to be linked and passed on the same day?
This brings us back to the original question. What does the police contract and the convention center remodel have in common? The two things, in this case, were similar on only two counts: the timing of when they were presented to council and the fact that the majority of city council members wanted each to be funded, at least in part, by the city’s downtown assets fund. (Exciting stuff, I know. The 
downtown assets fund
 is an umbrella fund largely from local taxes that supports public assets including the convention center, Target Center and Peavey Plaza.)
 


 


When City Council Vice President Aisha Chughtai, who is also head of the council’s finance committee, presented a funding proposal for the police contract on July 18, many council members expressed confusion over why the convention center’s funding was presented in tandem.

This week, Chughtai told MinnPost the issue came down to “needs and wants” and timing. The police contract needed to be funded. Chughtai called the convention center remodel “a want.” Additionally, the $13 million funding for the convention center renovation was being presented at the same time as the police contract. “In the background of all of this we’re facing a tough budget year,” Chughtai said, noting that Minneapolis is facing a $21.6 million deficit. 
Notably, the police contract funding plan Chughtai presented deviated greatly from Mayor Jacob Frey’s plan. Frey originally called for using funds already allocated for comprehensive public safety and policing alternative programs to pay for the forthcoming police raises, which many council members decried, saying this would pull from public safety initiatives like violence interrupters and various community-based groups removed from the police department. 
“The mayor’s original proposed funding was gutting unarmed public safety measures to pay for the federation contract,” Chughtai said this week. 
 


 


The plan Chughtai presented to council pulled from the city’s downtown asset funds and American Rescue Plan money that is set to expire to pay for the more than $9 million in future raises for police. At the July 18 meeting, the council vice president said “an entire part of this getting to this place is both of them (the police contract and convention center) being one act.” 
Council Member Katie Cashman, who represents Ward 7 where the Minneapolis Convention Center is located, said she met with convention center staff and council members the morning the council was set to vote on the police contract and its funding. At the time, axing the convention center funding and funneling it into the police contract was under consideration. Cashman said she advocated that both needed to be funded and that the council could tap into the downtown asset fund.

As for how the two became linked together – “It was a question of whether Frey would veto the proposal, and that’s why the convention center was put into the position of being (used as) leverage,” Cashman said.  
Within the next week, it was neither signed nor vetoed by Mayor Jacob Frey, which means it ultimately passed, as the mayor has only five days to veto an ordinance 
per the city’s charter. 
 


 


 


 


Mayor Jacob Frey told MinnPost he is concerned about the council’s budget plan on two counts. He said the council has allocated public safety aid funds to things city staff say they simply cannot do. Additionally, he is concerned pulling from the downtown assets fund will ultimately lead to a need to increase city property tax levies. According to Frey, the budget passed by the council leaves about $4.5 million sitting unused in the public safety aid fund.  
While Frey says council believes no public safety aid funds should go to police, he believes some of those dollars should be funneled into raises outlined in the contract. He noted that he and his administration also believe in supporting non-police public safety efforts as well. “We are 100% for that,” he said.  
As the council discussed the convention center funding during its Aug. 1 meeting, some members spoke out against how the convention center project was used as leverage. At last week’s meeting Ward 13 Linea Palmisano called what happened “quid pro quo” and said the convention center project was “held hostage and used as a bargaining chip.” 
“I don’t think that’s the kind of precedent we want to set as a body,” she said.

Meanwhile, at a July committee meeting, Ward 3 council member Michael Rainville expressed concerns over pulling from downtown asset funds, calling it “a slippery slope.” Rainville said he was a former convention center employee and therefore council members creating the budget should have consulted him on the proposal that lumped the center’s funding in with the police contract and pulled from the fund. 
“Once you take one penny out of that (downtown assets fund) you start to destroy the hospitality industry,” Rainville claimed. 
Ultimately, both the police contract funding and the convention center remodel funding were passed and passed separately and neither were vetoed by the mayor. While the police contract itself passed 8-4, five council members who supported it did not support the contract’s funding package that tapped the downtown assets fund, including Rainville, LaTrisha Vetaw, Andrea Jenkins, Emily Koski and Linea Palmisano.
There were many moments that made this end result seem unlikely, but advocates for both motions were successful in making their case. During a July 29 committee meeting, council member Jason Chavez thanked Cashman for her leadership in advocating for the convention center project. He said he was ready to not support the item but when he learned “how important it was” for Ward 7 and downtown, he changed his mind. 
“I just wanted to let the public know that council member Cashman lifted a big finger on this project and if it wasn’t for her leadership, I wouldn’t be voting for this, and I think a lot of people up here wouldn’t be voting on this either,” he said.  
This story has been updated to include comments from Mayor Jacob Frey and to reflect council member Rainville represents Ward 3, not 9.

Following his release from prison in early June, Moses Hubert, 33, was in a difficult position: trying to find a job to support his four children while having a felony conviction on his record. 
Earlier this month, he was pointed to T.O.U.C.H. Outreach, a violence prevention group that’s part of the Minneapolis violence interrupters program launched in 2021. T.O.U.C.H. Outreach, initially known as MinneapolUS, has in three years expanded and five separate groups now walking the city’s streets interacting with the community.
The T.O.U.C.H. Outreach team returned to their work on July 9 after renewing its contract, with Hubert among their ranks, to continue providing on-the-ground group violence prevention work through de-escalation tactics that treat violence as a public health concern.
 


 


“I get to come to work everyday, I get to put food on the table and take care of my kids and also get to be in the community and help out,” Hubert said. “I couldn’t ask for a better opportunity.”

On the ground, in the community
The T.O.U.C.H. Outreach team, made up of 25 to 30 unarmed members, works from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday – an upgrade from a previous schedule of six days a week for only a few hours each day. Saaundre Burns, 42, team lead for T.O.U.C.H. Outreach, said at the start of each shift his group splits into two smaller teams: one that covers the bulk of Lake Street in South Minneapolis from Lyndale Avenue to the light rail station on Hiawatha, while the other heads to Nicollet Mall downtown.

Burns said the work they do each night they’re out can vary significantly, and it can include administering NarCan to someone who is overdosing or buying something to eat for someone who is hungry, among many other things. But, he said, the bulk of what they do and what they’re trained to do is de-escalate situations that can turn into violence, and that takes instant relationship building.

“You really can’t tell a grown man or woman what to do, so we just try to influence them to choose a better choice before they make the wrong choice,” he said. “Some of them are receptive to it but a lot of them aren’t, so we get a lot of knuckleheads but we step back and let them know that we care for them. Sometimes we deter them and sometimes the violence still ensues, but for the most part we save a lot of lives out here.”
 


 


Donald Sturgis, 53, who has been working as part of the T.O.U.C.H. Outreach team for more than three years, said he has family members that have gone through things like homelessness and addiction, which has prompted him to assist community members experiencing the same situations.
As someone who has spent time in prison, Sturgis said he also sees himself in young men in the street, and he uses his experiences to relate when trying to engage and de-escalate.

“I know the hole that lies ahead so I can tell them about it so they don’t have to fall in it,” he said. “I believe that some people make mistakes so that others don’t have to make them.”
Muhammad Abdul-Ahad, T.O.U.C.H. Outreach founder and executive director, echoed Sturgis, and said he was intentional about hiring individuals like Hubert and Sturgis to help with the outreach effort. In addition to providing employment opportunities to those who may have trouble finding work due to a past criminal record, he said their lived experience can be a powerful asset in their community outreach work.
 


 


 


 


“The testimony that they’re able to share with some of these young individuals that are out on the street can help impact their lives and help them make some of the best decisions for them,” Abdul-Ahad said. “Now these are some of the same individuals that are impacting other people’s lives in a positive way and giving them hope, showing them that there are opportunities out there.”
Donald Sturgis has been working with T.O.U.C.H. Outreach for nearly 3.5 years.

Future of the program
The violence interrupter groups are overseen by the city’s Department of Neighborhood Safety, one of the five departments housed within the Office of Community Safety, which also includes police, fire, 911 and emergency management. Like the behavioral crisis response teams that respond with unarmed mental health professionals, the interrupter program came about in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer amid a widespread re-evaluation of public safety and desire for alternatives to law enforcement response.
The contracts between the groups and the city total $4.2 million, according to Office of Community Safety spokesman Brian Feintech. The city is planning to release a request for proposals early next year to invite more organizations to apply.

Each of the five groups currently contracted with the city are trained by Cure Violence Global, an organization that developed an approach to treat violence as a public health issue. The approach has been used by cities such as Charlotte and New York City to great effect, producing 
significant reductions in killings
 by 75% and 63%, respectively. 
 


 


Neighborhood Safety Department (NSD) Director Luana Nelson-Brown said in a statement that the city of Minneapolis is now finalizing a three-year contract with Cure Violence Global to provide more training to the violence prevention groups currently under contract with the city and any newly funded organizations in 2025.

NSD is also preparing to hire staff to take the burden of collecting data off of the violence interrupter groups themselves and make data collection more consistent across the groups to facilitate analysis of the success and effectiveness of their work. In the meantime, Cure Violence Global will assist the city with data collection that includes incidents of community contact and mediations.
“The currently funded organizations have been diligent in doing this difficult work every day,” Nelson-Brown said in a statement. “They deserve to have that work acknowledged and to see their success in qualitative and quantitative form.”

A park on St. Paul’s East Side underwent a major upgrade over the weekend with inspiration coming from those who use the playspace most: neighborhood kids. 
The playground at 
Hayden Heights Recreation Center
 was about 25 years old and in need of some major updates, said Andy Rodriguez, director of the St. Paul Parks and Recreation Department.

From design to installation, community members led the creation of the new updated playground. In May, St. Paul youth shared drawings of what their dream playground would look like. Those ideas were integrated into the new playground design. Then, on Saturday morning, community members volunteered to help build the new park. 
 


 


“I’ve had a chance to experience it,” Rodriguez said of the community engagement process. “It’s quite cool to see how excited young people get when envisioning a new play area.”
Over the weekend, neighborhood residents continued to swing by the park throughout its construction.
 


 


“It was fun to see them say, ‘Oh, there’s the shade structure that we recommended, or there’s the slide we talked about,’” Rodreguez said. 
The new playscape is part of a nationwide effort to improve equity in parks headed by international nonprofit KABOOM!, and St. Paul parks partnered with the Greater East Side Community Council, Equitable Advisors and Canopy Financial Group on the project. 
 


 


The new playground at Hayden Heights Recreation Center cost around $350,000, Rodriguez said.
It is part of a $7.5 million investment to address gaps in playspace access across the country, according to a KABOOM! news release. 
The city expects to accelerate the number of park projects done each year, targeting three to five locations per year, Rodriguez said. 
Here’s a look at the kids drawings that inspired the new park:

Originally published by 
The 19th


The place was empty except for Jenny Nguyen and the cable guy, who had just finished hooking up the two TVs. Soon, this small room in Portland, Oregon, would be the nation’s first women’s sports bar. It would rarely know quiet like this again. 


Nguyen flicked through the TV schedule and found two college women’s basketball games. She put one on each screen, and settled into a brown leather booth across from their twin glows. 


It didn’t take long for the tears to come.
Nguyen, a former chef, had been playing with the idea of opening a bar dedicated to women’s sports since 2018. But she considered herself risk averse and pretty unambitious. She’d been unemployed for five years. And yet, once the idea took hold, she couldn’t quite shake it. 


One night in 2021, she had been talking to a woman she was dating who, like Nguyen, had played basketball. (Nguyen played through high school until she tore her ACL at 19.) They envisioned a bar where the TVs only played women’s sports and no one batted an eye. It would be a place for families. How cool it would have been, they thought, to have had a place like that when they were kids or teenagers? What about now, in their 40s? 


“We both realized that a space like that didn’t exist for us. When I thought about the young me, I thought, ‘God, if we can get one kid in here that could feel represented and feel like there’s a future for them in sports, even if that one kid had that moment, it would be worth it,’” Nguyen said.

When Nguyen launched a 
Kickstarter campaign
 for the bar in February 2022, it was fully funded within nine days, ultimately racking up more than $105,000 from 600-plus donors. She found a spot in Portland’s Sullivan’s Gulch neighborhood next to a music shop. Inside, a bar ran along one end of the room and leather benches along the other. A basketball net chandelier hangs near a chalkboard menu listing 21 taps, all beers either made by women or at breweries owned or operated by women. Nguyen crafted a sophisticated bar menu (“Aunt Tina’s Vietna-wings,” a Vietnamese take on chicken wings, and a tempeh Reuben are on offer) and a cheeky cocktail list. The Title IX, one of their signature cocktails, is a mix of bourbon, peach liqueur and mint.


Around the entire room: scores of memorabilia — almost all donated — that pay homage to local and national teams. One of Nguyen’s favorites: a quilt of the iconic moment in 1999 when, after her penalty kick clinched the World Cup for the United States, Brandi Chastain ripped off her shirt and knelt on the turf in her sports bra. 


When “The Sports Bra” popped into Nguyen’s head, she was sure it was the name for her bar, even when people pushed back saying it was, somehow, too risqué. She just thought about it differently. 


“I wouldn’t change much of what a sports bar is, but I would just change the channel on the TV. So I just took ‘sports bar’ and I switched the two letters,” she said. “The key is: The tiny changes make the biggest difference.”


As she sat before her two televisions, Nguyen recalled fighting to watch just 
one
 women’s basketball game at a bar — and to be thankful to view it even with the sound off. But now, here she was, in a bar she created, watching two women’s games at once — something so seemingly mundane that had been out of reach for so long. 


Nguyen did not yet know that The Sports Bra would sprint its way to profitability, inspiring others to open nearly a dozen similar bars across the country. She did not know that “The Bra,” as patrons affectionately refer to it, would become a part of the evolution of women’s sports. That night, it was just the cable guy, Nguyen and her bar — almost to the finish line.




The Bra opened in April 2022, a 40-seat museum to women’s sports greatness. The front door is plastered with a mural of women athletes. Practically every available surface is lined with autographed jerseys, trophies, cleats and balls. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert signed the wall. On opening day, lines were out the door.


The Bra hit 
nearly $1 million
 in revenue in just eight months — a lightning-fast streak to profitability, especially for the hospitality industry. The bar’s success has been so monumental that it 
helped Portland win its bid
 to host the Women’s Final Four in 2030. Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden used it as 
the venue to pitch
 Engelbert on expanding the WNBA to Portland. 


The Bra and 
Rough and Tumble
, a women’s sports bar that opened in late 2022 in Seattle,  have inspired the launch of similar bars in 
Long Beach
, 
New York City
, 
Minneapolis
, 
Austin
, 
Kansas City
, 
San Francisco
, 
Atlanta
, 
Chicago
 and 
Denver
. There’s at least one group chat for owners who are starting out.

As The Bra has grown — there are now five TVs showing everything from roller derby to pickleball — its mission has expanded from being a place for women sports fans to also being a haven for the queer community (one poster declares, “Protect Trans Kids”), a place for people of color (a Black Lives Matter flag hangs over the bar) and for men. As Nguyen originally envisioned, kids are allowed until 10 p.m. 


The Bra hosted a letter-writing campaign for Phoenix Mercury player Brittney Griner when she was detained in Russia, a Juneteenth showcase for Black women sports photographers, fundraisers for Planned Parenthood and a candlelight vigil for the victims of the shooting at Club Q, a queer nightclub in Colorado Springs. 


Nguyen contracts with women-owned companies to supply food and drink for The Bra, propping up other proprietors in fields dominated by men. Portland distillery Freeland Spirits provides four of the cocktails on the menu. (Less than 
8 percent
 of distilleries are owned at least in part by women, and it’s likely that fewer are solely women-owned.) Carman Ranch provides the grass-fed beef. (About 
9 percent
 of farms are run entirely by women.) 


The bar has symbolized other things she didn’t expect, too. Nguyen is Vietnamese, but said she grew up with some shame about her background, always trying to be American enough. But opening The Bra has helped her reconnect with those roots, particularly after she saw how eagerly her community embraced the venture.


“I had people who were Vietnamese women business owners — they were very moved by what we are doing here. That is not something that had crossed my mind, that I was a Vietnamese woman opening a sports bar,” Nguyen said. “Once I realized the power of what we were doing here, it made being intentional about things a very high priority.” 


The Bra is the kind of idea many women’s sports fans say they wish 
they’d
 had. In fact, Nguyen estimates that six or seven people have told her they’d had an idea for a bar with the same name. The difference, of course, is that she acted on it, and did so at a pivotal moment: Deloitte estimates women’s sports will surpass 
$1 billion
 in global revenue this year. 


“What I love about [The Sports Bra] is it’s in your face, in that you can witness the success and the popularity and the excitement. And if you’re a naysayer, sit back and go, ‘Oh, there’s actually something here,’” said Alicia Jessop, a sports industry expert who founded the sports business website 
RulingSports.com
. 


Particularly in the past three years, Jessop said, social media has allowed athletes to circumvent the limitations of broadcast media to create their own followings. New rules regarding name, image and likeness compensation for NCAA athletes have allowed them to earn money from endorsements, and the number of women scoring those deals soared during 
the 2023-2024 season
.


“The powder in the keg is getting ready to explode,” said Jessop, now an associate professor at Pepperdine University, about the popularity of women’s sports. “This train is off and it is moving and it is moving quick — it’s getting to the point where you need to hop on because it’s going to be gone.” 


Practically every available surface at The Bra is lined with autographed jerseys, trophies, cleats and balls. 
 
(Christine Dong for The 19th)


Like most customers, Erin Gallagher has a story about the 
first time she stepped inside
 The Sports Bra. A lifelong soccer player and two-time founder, Gallagher was moved by Nguyen’s story. “I’m always really drawn to women who decide to take an idea and do something with it. I understand on a visceral level the fear of doing that,” said Gallagher, the founder of Ella, a network for women leaders and entrepreneurs that provides consulting and help with access to capital.


She spent her first half-hour there last month just taking in all the memorabilia, from floor to ceiling. Big things, like a jersey signed by breakout basketball star Caitlin Clark, and little things, like kids’ sports trophies. Her eyes landed on a jersey signed by Mia Hamm, the ‘90s soccer star — and Gallagher’s childhood idol.


“Every inch of those walls was covered in women’s success,” Gallagher said. “Normally we have an inch, we have a back hallway, we have a strip of something. This is every inch.”  




Women’s sports and The Bra’s winning streak have fueled each other. 


For most of their history, women’s professional teams and their fan bases have been much smaller than those of their male counterparts. The WNBA was founded in 1996 and today has 12 teams compared to the NBA’s 30. A smaller WNBA fan base led to smaller player deals and less revenue from tickets, merchandise and broadcast rights. The 2022-2023 season drew 22.2 million fans to NBA games and about 
$10 billion
 in revenue, while the WNBA drew 1.6 million fans and about 
$200 million
 in revenue.
Player pay is based on a league’s revenue, and since the WNBA is many times less profitable than the NBA, that has led to disparities in what top players are paid. WNBA players are also entitled to a smaller share of revenue overall. About 50 percent of the NBA’s revenue is spent on salaries, a result of the players’ bargaining power, which has amassed over decades and ensured better contracts. In the WNBA, only 10 percent of league revenue is reserved for player pay.
That means that Caitlin Clark, whose impressive rise as a point guard at the University of Iowa earned her a spot 
among the best college basketball players of all time
, will be paid $76,535 as the top WNBA draft pick by the Indiana Fever. In the NBA, the No. 1 draft pick, Zaccharie Risacher,
 
will be paid $12.6 million — 165 times more. 


Overall, women’s sports get only about 15 percent of all airtime — a jump from three decades of commanding just 5 percent of airtime. 
 
(Christine Dong for The 19th)


In soccer, players in the National Women’s Soccer League top out at about 
$400,000 a year
, but salaries for Major League Soccer reach as high as 
$20.4 million
. The United States Soccer Federation, which oversees both leagues, also sends men’s and women’s teams to compete in World Cup tournaments. It took a 
six-year battle
 for athletes on the U.S. women’s national team to begin earning the same as men, even though the women have four World Cup titles and four Olympic gold medals, and the men have none.


Overall, women’s sports get only about 
15 percent 
of all airtime — a jump from three decades of commanding just 
5 percent
 of airtime. But that still means fans have to work harder to watch their teams. A recent study by sports marketing researchers found that one of the key differences between WNBA and NBA fans is that women’s basketball fans often watch alone. More than 1 in 4 WNBA fans 
said they have no one
 to watch or go to games with, or even talk to about the league. In other words, they lack the camaraderie that fuels fandom. Men’s sports have had that for years thanks, in part, to sports bars.


“Creating a bar where you have fans coming into a space and you have a sporting event on and they’re now interacting with each other — that is a huge part of the fan experience that didn’t exist before. It illustrates your fan base has gotten big enough for that to happen,” said David Berri, a professor of economics at Southern Utah University. 


Still, he points out, when men’s sports were starting out, they didn’t have much of a fan base either. People forget that, said Berri, who is also co-author of the upcoming book, “Slaying the Trolls! Why the Trolls are Very, Very Wrong About Women and Sports.” In the early years of the NBA, attendance was so poor that Maurice Podoloff, the league’s first president, 
told team owners
 in 1949, “If you can avoid giving the figures out, do so. If however, you must announce figures, a little padding will be forgiven.”


Berri notes that the NBA has been around for 75 years, while the WNBA is only 28 years old. Yet the WNBA is on the same growth trajectory as the men’s league, given its age,
 
he said. And next year, the WNBA union contract will be up for renewal, which could help improve payment structures.


The NBA, which owns 60 percent of the women’s league, 
reportedly
 just secured a $200 million annual media rights deal for the WNBA — up from $60 million a year — that could help improve pay. But Terri Jackson, the executive director of the players’ union, called it an 
undervaluation
 after an electrifying few years for women’s sports. This year, the NCAA women’s basketball championship between Iowa and South Carolina drew 18.9 million viewers on average, 
surpassing viewership
 for the men’s final. The WNBA draft drew 2.45 million, 
another record
. 


More than 1 in 4 WNBA fans said they have no one to watch or go to games with, or even talk to about the league. In other words, they lack the camaraderie that fuels fandom.

In 2023, the Women’s World Cup also hit an 
all-time attendance record
. That year, the National Women’s Soccer League secured the 
largest-ever
 media deal in women’s sports at $240 million — more than 50 times the previous deal. 


The Olympics will be another opportunity to prove that point. Historically, women’s sports are among the most-watched — 
gymnastics
 and 
figure skating
, especially the women’s competitions, top the Summer and Winter Games, respectively. 


The Sports Bra definitely won’t be missing the moment.
 
Earlier this year, Alexis Ohanian, Reddit co-founder and the husband of tennis champion Serena Williams, considered by many one of the 
best athletes of all time
, announced that his foundation would 
invest in The Sports Bra
 as it ventures into franchising. “Hundreds upon hundreds” of inquiries have poured in from fans who want to have a Sports Bra in their own cities, Nguyen said.


She said she hopes to open franchise applications this summer, and her focus will be on finding owners who are connected to their communities, who can bring her vision for The Bra to their hometowns. 


It won’t be easy. Expansion is costly, and The Bra has been spending a significant amount preparing to franchise. Revenue has stayed about steady but hasn’t topped that explosive — albeit unsustainable — start.


But in some ways, Nguyen already knows the franchises can be successful. That’s because other sports bars that have tried to recreate the magic of The Bra have already proven it.




Jillian Hiscock has a story about her first time at The Sports Bra, too. She was visiting Portland from Minneapolis, and on her second night at The Bra, a mom entered with two young girls in their tiny soccer practice outfits. As the mom waited at the bar, the girls looked around, their eyes bulging as they took in all the images of women sports heroes.


“That is going to be normal for them,” Hiscock realized, “to see women prioritized at that level.” 


Hiscock previously worked in college admissions. She had no bar experience. But after that trip, she decided to open her own spot. Much like Nguyen, she was able to quickly fundraise: 
$205,000
 from 
40 states and four countries
. In March, she opened A Bar of Their Own, named after the 1992 film about an all-women baseball league, “A League of Their Own.”
The bar offers gluten-free and vegan food. It carries non-alcoholic drink options. It has accessible seating for people with disabilities. It has gender-neutral bathrooms. Almost every business Hiscock has worked with is owned by a woman, a transgender person or a nonbinary person, from the construction company and the painters to the drinks vendors. Seventeen of the 18 tap lines are from breweries that are women-, trans- or nonbinary-owned, each delineated with a 
star
 on the menu. The bar also works with Freeland Spirits, the same Portland company The Bra does.

Nguyen, who has served as an unofficial consultant on many of the newer bars, offered her tips for Hiscock: Stick to your guns — make the place what you want it to be. And stop every once in a while to take it in. 


Taking a stand hasn’t been hard for Hiscock, who says she’s always had “strong opinions.” She remembers beer reps telling her she wouldn’t be successful if she didn’t sell Michelob and Miller Lite — the two most popular beers at sports bars. 


“What’s the number-one-selling beer at women’s sports bars?” she asked them. 


Crickets. 


“OK, well, I’ll tell you in a year once we’re open and we’ll go from there,” she said. (The favorite so far, by the way, is the Shortstop Pils, which was made for the bar by Urban Growler Brewing, a queer women-owned brewery in St. Paul.)


Not long ago, someone slapped a sticker to the front door of the bar that read, “
Keep female sports female
” — part of the call to 
keep trans women out of women’s sports
. In response, for Pride, the bar staff 
made koozies
 that read: “Let trans kids play.” 


In Austin, Debra Hallum and Marlene du Plessis are 
preparing to open
 their own place later this year. They’re calling it ATX Women’s Sports Pub. Like Hiscock, the co-founders don’t have a bar background — Hallum worked in telecommunications and du Plessis in educational leadership. But they are fans who also took a trip to a women’s sports bar, Seattle’s Rough and Tumble, and came back transformed. They rely on a text group chat that includes the owners of the other bars that are just starting out to answer questions, like about how to stream women’s sports and how to do pop-up events. 


Like the others, they’re taking an intentional approach to their establishment. For one, it’ll be a pub, not a bar, because they feel “pub” connotes more of a family space, said du Plessis, who is from South Africa. They also want it to be a place for LGBTQ+ people and for men. They hope ATX Women’s Sports Pub will host fundraisers for local women’s teams, and opportunities for residents to meet the players.


“If we have a youth league in Austin who needs some kind of assistance, we want to make sure girls get to play what they want to play. If a girl cannot afford her uniform, we want our community to be thriving so well that we either find a way to help them get that uniform or, as a business, we cover that uniform,” Hallum said. “There are so many things we want to make sure we’re helping with.”


In Minneapolis, A Bar of Their Own has now been open for four months. Most days, it’s pretty busy. At the end of a long day, Hiscock likes to pull up a chair with her wife and drink a beer — not Michelob or Miller Lite. The walls there also have stories. Tennis legend Billie Jean King signed one of them. The woman who runs the construction company Hiscock used donated an entire shadowbox of memorabilia. Turns out, she was on the first-ever U.S. women’s rugby team. The bar even has some souvenirs from the USA women’s bandy team — a quirky, little-known combination of ice hockey, field hockey and soccer.

(Christine Dong for The 19th)


It has always nagged Hiscock that while most people can recognize some NFL quarterbacks or name the teams that recently played in the Super Bowl, it’s been impossible to be a casual women’s sports fan. If you want to follow a team you love, she likes to say, you need a “master’s degree in streaming services.”


Now, she’s watching that change. Not too long ago, a family with two little boys came into the bar, and one of the boys got wrapped up watching a Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball game. He’d never watched women’s sports in his life, his mom told Hiscock. Honestly, what he probably liked was that the team wore his favorite color: orange. 


But Hiscock has seen the family come in a few times now — and learned that the little boy asked for a Vols shirt for his birthday. 


“This is what his norm is going to be,” Hiscock said. “Now there’s this little boy running around with the Volunteers’ women’s basketball shirt that he has no connection to — other than he saw it at A Bar of Their Own.” 




When Serena Williams played her final match at the U.S. Open in September 2022, The Sports Bra had been open just five months. Nguyen threw every rule about seating capacity out the door so that as many fans as possible could stand shoulder to shoulder.


As Williams took on Ajla Tomljanović, fans stuck outside cupped their hands to the glass to catch whatever glimpse they could of the match. 


“Someone flipped a burger and you could hear it sizzling,” Nguyen said. “When Serena would score a point, it felt like the glass was gonna break.” 


When Williams lost, Nguyen passed out boxes of Kleenex. 


She looked around and thought:
 I don’t think this moment is happening anywhere other than here. And maybe at the U.S. Open in New York. Maybe. 


Two weeks later, a woman who had been at the U.S. Open came by to drop off some memorabilia. 


“Guess what?” the woman asked her. 


What?


“While I was watching Serena Williams play her last match, I wondered what it was like at The Bra.”

The Minneapolis Behavioral Crisis Response team has responded to more than 10,000 calls for service since shifting to 24/7 service a year ago, the nonprofit told a Minneapolis City Council committee on Wednesday.
At the end of June, the crisis response program, operated by Canopy Roots, completed its first full year of 24-hour service as a team of mental health responders dispatched by 911, and the increased hours led to a dramatic increase in service. During that time frame, the crisis response team responded to 10,369 incidents with zero injuries — a more than 50% increase compared to the same time period the year before.
During that time frame, the average responses per month increased from 574 responses per month between July 2022 and July 2023, to 874 responses per month between July 2023 and July 2024, illustrating a continued demand for their services after increasing their hours. Previously the team only worked weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to midnight.
 


 


Since its launch in December 2021, the program has responded to more than 20,500 calls for service, approaching each call with the aims of decreasing criminalization of mental illness and avoiding involuntary hospitalization.

“The support that we’ve gotten from the city and from every entity that is involved in the city from (council members) to the police to fire and EMS, it just shows how much we feel appreciated and valued as co-responders the same as any other response from 911 services,” Dean Zoller, a mental health responder on the crisis response team, told members of the Public Health and Safety Committee on Wednesday. “I think this can only get bigger and better, and I’ve never heard a person complain about us being around first.”

The crisis response program is made up of unarmed, trained mental health professionals who are dispatched by 911 in pairs to assist individuals experiencing mental health crises, and provide de-escalation, emotional support and connection to services. The program began two years ago as a pilot amid a desire by Minneapolis officials and residents to develop public safety responses that went beyond armed law enforcement — a desire brought on by the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. 
 


 


“This new branch of the Minneapolis public safety system helps to increase the public safety and health of residents by ensuring they get the support that is most appropriate for their needs, reducing police contact for communities that continue to have adverse experiences with law enforcement and creating efficiencies that help ensure officers are available to respond to issues most in line with their skill set,” said Gina Obiri, contract operations manager for Canopy Roots. 
 


 


Mayor Jacob Frey in February announced an extension to the program’s contract in the 2023-2024 biennial budget, bringing the total amount to $5.9 million. 
Because the program has been a success, it is likely it’ll be extended beyond its current August 2025 expiration date during the council’s upcoming budget negotiations. But also due to its success and demand, it’ll likely see an expansion of its services, requiring more investment from the city going forward.

The group asked the council on Wednesday for immediate funding to purchase another vehicle for their fleet that isn’t a van so supervisors can join responders at the scene for assistance. Longer-term asks include competitive pay increases for responders in order to attract higher quality responders and to keep up with inflation, as well as a pay equity analysis for mental health responders versus responders from traditional agencies.
Council President Elliott Payne praised the crisis response team’s work, which he said has made the success of public safety beyond policing in Minneapolis more possible.  
 


 


“One of the hardest things when we were trying to start this program was people’s just disbelief that it could possibly work, these kinds of flippant comments like, ‘What are you going to do, send a social worker to a bank robbery?’ People just could not envision anything other than police being a first responder,” Payne said. “This is just the beginning of the vision, but I think that vision is now more tangible for so many more people because you’re out there in the real world everyday making that difference.”

Update: At its Wednesday, July 24 meeting, St. Paul City Council approved the expansion of the St. Paul Downtown Improvement District. 
Who should pay additional dollars to keep downtown St. Paul safe and clean?
Since 2020, commercial and industrial property owners have provided the bulk of funding for the city’s Downtown Improvement District. But a plan to nearly triple the district’s footprint and double its operating budget would tap a new group of fee payers: downtown homeowners. 
 


 


The St. Paul City Council, which could vote on the plan as early as Wednesday, was able to consider adding residential property owners to the mix because of a 2023 state law change, said Joe Spencer, president of the St. Paul Downtown Alliance, which manages the improvement district. 
Minnesota law previously prohibited cities from applying mandatory special assessment district fees to residential property owners, placing the burden on commercial and industrial property owners. Other parties – including exempt property owners and city and county agencies – could contribute to the district voluntarily. Now, residential properties can be included in the assessment. 
“The notion there (from the Legislature) is, if people are going to be affected by a fee, and they’re going to be included in this new district that is for the private sector, by the private sector, you have to include them in the process,” Spencer said. “So we started a new process for a new district with a new universe of participants.”

While those who own homes or condos downtown — including Lowertown — would be included under the proposed plan, these owners would pay 40% less than what a commercial property owner pays for the district. Under this model, residential property owners would cover a little less than 25% of the expanded improvement district’s budget, which would increase from $1.3 million to $2.7 million a year. Commercial and residential property owners would cover about $2 million, and the city and Ramsey county would contribute $439,000 and $243,000, respectively.
 


 


There are two reasons residential property owners would pay less, Spencer said. First, this percentage breakdown of the fees is considered general best practice across the country in states where residential properties are approved in these districts. Second, there are fewer people per square foot in residential than in commercial properties, he said.

Downtown residents at the final public hearing for the proposal held last week said they would likely pay around $5 a month in assessment fees. Spencer said those comments were in reference to the cost estimated to be paid by the average condo, which totals around $65.50 per year. 
Downtown improvement districts are a common model used across the country, Spencer noted. 
 


 


For example, Minneapolis has touted its downtown improvement district for about a decade. Downtown Minneapolis residents don’t currently pay fees toward the district, and city officials did not respond to a request for comment before publication on whether the change in state law will lead to changes there. 
 


 


Patrick Skinner, St. Paul Downtown Improvement District treasurer and chief management officer of Unilev Capital Corp., said at the hearing that his company, which owns the Wells Fargo Place office tower, has reaped the benefits from the improvement district. 
Unilev Capital Corp. owns a total of about 5 million square feet across the country, including in cities like Billings, Montana; Knoxville, Tennessee; Cincinnati, Ohio; and St. Louis, Missouri, Skinner said. Some of these cities have downtown improvement districts while others don’t.
“I can tell you that a downtown improvement district is a key tool for downtown to be successful,” Skinner said.

St. Paul’s downtown district was first created in 2020 via council ordinance. This year, a new steering committee was formed to include both commercial and residential property owners, including Skinner.  
 


 


“I would challenge some of those who said this is still an experiment. It’s not. It’s a proven concept. And now it’s time to expand that to the rest of downtown as a best practice,” Skinner said. 
Other property owners, however, are opposed to the district’s expansion. 
In a July 10 
public comment letter to the St. Paul City Council, 
an attorney representing Madison Equities, the company that owns the most property in downtown St. Paul, painted a bleak picture of downtown and questioned the idea that private property owners should pay an additional fee for the district. 
“Any increased tax dollars would be better spent elsewhere, including the hiring of more real police officers to provide enhanced safety,” wrote the attorney, Kelly Hadac. 
At the same time, Madison Equities is looking to leave downtown for good, 
as all of its properties there are up for sale.

The Center for Racial and Health Equity
 generously supports MinnPost’s Race & Health Equity coverage; 
learn why
.
 


After a hard day at work, what Princess Titus wanted most was to “feed her heart,” which, at the time, craved fried chicken and hot sauce. 
Titus, senior engagement officer and one of three co-founders of Appetite for Change, a north Minneapolis organization centered on food and urban agriculture, was set to meet that night to cook with members of AFC’s youth program. But when they met, she told them there had been a change of plans. Instead of cooking food together, Titus told them to take her credit card and “go across the street and get 50 wings from Hooks.”
To her surprise, however, the young people weren’t pleased with her offer — they were, they told her, “tired of eating that.” They left, only to return with a new goal. 
 


 


“They came back with data,” Titus said. “They surveyed the West Broadway corridor and said that there (were) 38 fast food restaurants. There (were) four buildings that didn’t have anything on ’em, and they didn’t know what was going on in those buildings. And there were so many vacant lots. And there was an open space right in the building where we were officing and it was like, ‘We should open a restaurant right there.’” 
That goal became reality in 2015, when Breaking Bread Cafe was opened. While the restaurant has since closed, AFC’s other programs — including three urban farms, a program that brings together people to cook and a youth training program — are still in full swing. 
The legacy of Breaking Bread Cafe lives on, in part, in the Appetite for Change cookbook, “Appetite for Change: Soulful Recipes from a North Minneapolis Kitchen.” Published July 9, the cookbook is available for purchase. 
The cookbook began when Beth Dooley, an author/co-author of various cookbooks, including  “Appetite for Change,” approached LaChelle Cunningham, who was the executive chef of Breaking Bread Cafe, with the idea of a Breaking Bread cookbook. 
 


 


“We all sat around and (were) like, ‘Well, the recipes that we would wanna share with the community are much broader than just what’s on the Breaking Bread Cafe menu,” said Michelle Horovitz, co-founder and dedicated volunteer at Appetite for Change. 
The cookbook contains recipes, along with the story of the organization’s impact and stories of the leaders contributing to the book, including Horovitz and Titus.
Seeds of Change 
Appetite for Change began with three women — Tasha Powell, Michelle Horovitz and Princess Titus — focused on making positive change in north Minneapolis.
“Tasha at the time was a struggling vegetarian, who had lost faith in the food system and (was) looking to create a new way of consuming,” said Horovitz, a founder and volunteer at AFC.

“I had just moved back from Miami and was a recovering public defender looking for a way to combine my passion for food and racial and social justice,” Horovitz said. “Princess was ‘a refugee from Chicago,’ she liked to say, and was doing a ton of community work on the Northside. The three of us connected around the inequities in our food system, the concerns and questions that we had about where our food was coming from and how food can be used as a tool for social change.”
Michelle Horovitz
A lack of food security, defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life,” has been an issue for some time in Minnesota, with the state ranked the 7th worst in the nation for access to healthy foods. More recently, in 2022, according to Feeding America’s food insecurity map, the overall food insecurity rate in Minnesota was 9.4%. At the same time, food insecurity rates for Black and Latino Minnesotans were much higher than the overall rate at 29% and 23%, respectively.
In 2024, the problem persists, according to Bukata Hayes, vice president of racial and health equity at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota. 
“There’s still urban and greater Minnesota communities that are considered food deserts, where there isn’t access to fresh, healthy food,” said Hayes, whose organization, under their Food Justice Funding Initiative, supports the work of Appetite for Change and eleven other community-based food-access organizations. Blue Cross Blue Shield also supports MinnPost’s race and health equity coverage, but does not weigh in on editorial decisions. 
 


 


Titus has understood the importance of food for a healthy life since her childhood. In the recently published cookbook, Titus discussed how her mother provided her with a diet of “liver, greens, broccoli, spinach and fruit” after her diagnosis of thalassemia, a blood condition leading to anemia, at 8-years old. Doctors, she recalled, “were amazed” by her quick recovery. 
Princess Titus
Growing food has also been a mechanism for healing in her life. In 2010, Titus’s son Anthony was murdered two weeks after his 16th birthday by a bullet meant for another child. 
A year later, Titus wrote in the cookbook, she saw that “Anthony’s strawberries,” which he’d planted a month before his death, had sprouted once again. She saw in strawberries a message from him to her — a message to “return to the garden, to the kitchen, and reconnect with the land, my family and community through food.” Shortly afterward, Titus met Horovitz and Powell and the seeds of Appetite for Change itself were sown. 
Food justice and culture 
Food justice, as understood by Hayes, is about “giving back power” to communities that have had “the opportunity for culturally resonant, healthy, accessible food taken away.” Within this definition, cultural resonance is as important as considerations of health.
 


 


 


 


“Oftentimes we try and impose upon (communities) what healthy is,” said Hayes, adding that certain foods in various cultures are associated with the “resiliency” of those communities, including his own African-American community. “In this process (of working with community-based organizations through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota’s Food Justice Funding Initiative), we continue to listen, learn, partner and act off of what the community says would be both healthy and culturally reaffirming.” 
For the Black community, Titus said, cultural foods are “comfort foods that were built out of necessity, from being descendants of stolen people on stolen land.” 
“The word healthy became activating for community members,” Titus said, noting that when doctors have told people to eat healthily, it often means placing cultural comfort foods — which have sustained generations of families — off the table.
Instead of using the term healthy, Titus said, Appetite for Change calls its food “fresh and local” and works with community members to enhance nutrition while respecting cultural meals.
“If you have your fried chicken, maybe you don’t fry it,” Titus said. “Maybe you pan sear it. Maybe you use a healthier oil. Maybe we teach about the different fat content (of) certain oils. Maybe you oven fry it.”

One time, Titus recalled, AFC made breaded oven-fried chicken after community members identified “the crunch on the skin” as one of the integral things they liked about fried chicken. 
“How we take things that people like and give them opportunities to cook them in a way that would promote them having a better quality of life is really what we were trying to put into the cookbook,” Titus said.
One of Titus’ favorite recipes in the book is for jeweled cabbage — a version of her grandmother’s fried cabbage adapted into, she told MinnPost, “something that would help my grandmother live longer, had she been here.” Titus’ grandmother, she said, passed away as a result of diabetes and high blood pressure. 
The jeweled cabbage recipe involves “adding purple cabbage to that green cabbage recipe, adding bell peppers, adding yellow and red peppers to give it some color, to make it pop,” Titus explained. “You can’t leave out the orange (peppers); if you’re gonna do the yellow and the red, you might as well add the orange.”
With the addition of seasonings and stir-frying the peppers rather than “saute(ing) it until it’s melted down,” the cabbage is simple to make and, when it’s done, Titus added, “you’re eating to live.” 
The cookbook also contains recipes created in part by members of AFC’s youth program. From the beginning, said Titus, young people have been deeply involved in the organization’s work.

“Giving them a space where they could share their voice and have somebody hear their opinions about the foodscape was not something we could take back,” Titus said. “When we start(ed) cooking and eating, talking with the young people, they were leaving the corners. Our young people were gang- and clique-affiliated, juvenile-justice involved, truant, homeless (and facing) health-related issues. They were showing up when we didn’t even have work. They wanted to be with us after they grew their own food and ate it. And then they started to ask questions.” 
Perhaps the most evocative of these questions, Titus said, came from Lataijah Powell, Powell’s daughter, who currently runs the youth program at AFC. She asked: “Is this food here on West Broadway because we eat it or do we just eat it because it’s here?”
“When you have that type of thinking about your food,” Titus said, “you can create that internal change that will make you vote with your dollar and you won’t go get that six-piece wings because you know there’s other options.”

Facilitated by local artist seangarrison and sponsored by Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS), the day includes individual and group painting sessions, discussions about fatherhood and emotional expression and an intro to journaling exercises that encourage daily communication with children. No prior art experience is required. 
 


 


The program is free. Those who participate receive an art briefcase filled with art supplies, three art journals to complete with their children, a $200 stipend if they attend the full session and the painting they complete during that day. They also will participate in a group mural that will be displayed at MPS. 
Art can be a conduit to communicate and connect with children, seangarrison said. The class looks to teach fathers new ways to express themselves, bond with their children and connect with other fathers in the community.

“If you can create beauty where you thought none existed and give it to your child, that’s saying exactly what you want to say if you could say it perfectly,” seangarrison said. “Because art – when I create – that’s the most perfect thing I could ever do because it’s born in between my shoulders and not between my ears.” 
Every father’s relationship with their children is different, seangarrison noted. Some live in the same home as their children. Some don’t and many fathers have been socialized to be reserved and not show emotion. Every experience is unique. 
 


 


“How can we help these men celebrate themselves, communicate and communicate with other men and talk about some of the challenges and some of the joys – but then illustrate this thing through art?” seangarrison said this is the question this inaugural class looks to ask. 
If the class is successful, seangarrison hopes to take it to other school districts and regions. He believes it is a way to connect in new ways. 
 


 


The artist pointed out that fathers know better than most that a handmade gift is special. A father of three daughters, seangarrison’s  youngest is 15 years old. When she was three years old, she gave him a turtle she made out of a paper plate. 
“That sat shotgun with me for three years,” seangarrison said. Until, when she was six years old, she gave him a stuffed turtle called “Little Sean,” which he still keeps in his art studio in northeast Minneapolis. 
 


 


“So during all my shows, Little Sean is on side (of the) stage to keep her close to me,” seangarrison said. 
Father of four and MPS teacher Matt Branch was one of the first parents to sign up for the class. Branch has worked with seangarrison in the past and been a spectator at many of Garrison’s shows. He first met the artist during a live painting to music for the family of Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man killed by a police officer at a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center.

“It was just beautiful. I’d never cried publicly before. I’d never seen something so – something that I didn’t understand, but at the same time I fully understood it, and I was like, ‘this is art,’” Branch said. 
Branch said, as an adult, he has been inspired by seangarrison’s work and has witnessed its impact first-hand. As Branch’s children have grown, he’s watched them become artists as well, a gift he says he wants to help nurture. 
 


 


“I’m looking forward to opening myself up, being a little more vulnerable,” he said. “Art was never one of my strong suits in school and something I maybe even pushed back on. I was closed minded and maybe didn’t really understand all that art was and what it entailed and the power behind it.”

Ever since Harry “Spike” Moss was a boy in Minneapolis, he has been fighting for freedom, justice and equity. 
He has stood in hundreds of protests against racism and police brutality. He’s a man who was pivotal in the movement to desegregate the Minneapolis Fire Department, then the city’s police department, along with other businesses across the Twin Cities who refused to hire Black people.  
Many regard Moss as an activist. But the now 78-year-old man said he has never been that – he’s a freedom fighter. 
 


 


“You have to give clarity: freedom, justice, equality – in that order. That’s what you’re fighting for. You’re not even explaining it when you say you’re an activist,” Moss said.  
Now, Moss has become the first living man to have a street named after him in Minneapolis. 
Hundreds gathered to celebrate the renaming of Plymouth Avenue North between Newton and Lyndale Avenues North Tuesday. The stretch of road that once housed The Way Community Center, one of the first nonprofit community spaces for the north Minneapolis Black community, is now named “Spike Moss Way.”
The city often conducts street renaming postmortem, but an exception to this rule was made for Moss. State Sen. Bobby Joe Champion, Minneapolis, brought the proposal forward to the Minneapolis City Council to name the street after Moss. 
 


 


At the Tuesday event, people spoke of Moss’ many accomplishments and remembered The Way, which was built specifically to serve the Black community in north Minneapolis after the Plymouth Avenue uprisings of 1966. 
But as the celebration was happening, Moss had one eye on what came before him and another on what comes next. The Friday before the street renaming, Moss sat down with MinnPost at Turning Point, 1500 Golden Valley Rd., a drug and alcohol treatment facility where Moss works with those in recovery. 
He had much on his mind. He said, yes, he and many others stood up for the rights of Black and Native American communities for decades, but the fight is long from over. And the street renaming came after a long overdue reckoning in the city. 
“For Minnesota, the killing of George Floyd pulled the cover off, literally,” Moss said. “Then they could see everything I ever said. They couldn’t see it before then.”
 


 


This was his redemption, he said. For the first time, people saw what he saw all along. 
“It’s a new day for me in my lifetime because I don’t have to prove anything anymore,” Moss said. 
When asked how it felt to no longer have to prove anything, Moss paused. 
“If my mother and father were here to see it, it would feel great,” he said.

As Moss reflected on a life dedicated to fighting for his community, he kept finding himself remembering all that came before.
Remembering The Way
The location of the renamed street is significant in multiple parts. The Way Community Center was one of the first places built in the city by and for the north Minneapolis Black community. Moss was the center’s last executive director. After the center closed in the 1980s, the city’s Fourth Precinct Police Station was built in its place. The irony of this is not lost on anyone, Moss said. 
The Way was built in 1966 after a Black girl was beaten by police, he said. “They beat her with batons, which led to the first rebellion in the Twin Cities.”
Protestors met at Oak Park and, for the first time in Minneapolis history, a white mayor, Arthur Naftalin, who was also the city’s first Jewish mayor, came to Minneapolis’ Black community, Moss said. 
 


 


“Out of that discussion, we said we wanted a building where we could have our own place to socialize so we could be together, so we could be free,” he said.  
Clarence Benford, a friend of Moss, named this new space The Way. “The way to opportunities unlimited. The way to a new life. The way to a new way of life. We all agreed and named it The Way,” Moss reminisced.  
This was a place built by the community and for the community, specifically for the area’s youth, Moss said. Community members wanted it to be a place where people could socialize, so The Way had pinball machines, vending machines, billiards, a jukebox and a television. It became a place where youth could join various sports like football, baseball, boxing and track. Eventually, a drum and bugle corps was formed. Then, the center started organizing Miss Black Minnesota and Miss Northside pageants. 
“Then we built Freedom Day for Juneteenth. Then we built a Northside Summer Fun Fest and Youth Appreciation Day. And we just kept going,” Moss said.

But when police brutality in the city, particularly brutality against Black young men – teens and younger – didn’t stop, organizers at The Way knew more needed to be done. 
“We, as boys, stood up in our own building and began to push back,” he said. “At the time we didn’t know that, in Minnesota, they would not arrest police, they would not prosecute police, they would not charge them. We would have to be wrong. So they (police) began to villainize us. We were trouble makers, rabble rousers, Black militants, racists ourselves. It was just sickening, the insults and the attacks because the city wasn’t ready to deal with the racism.”
 


 


The Fourth Precinct police station opened in 
The Way’s location on Plymouth Avenue shortly after the community center closed in 1984
. Moss said it was opened there because former Minneapolis Police Chief Tony Bouza “hated us.” 
“He wanted to flash that in the middle of the Black community. It’s because they’ll never take a real look at racism,” Moss said. 
Those who came before 
If there’s one thing Moss said he wanted to come from this week, he wants to remember the people who shaped him.  
Moss carries the words of Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with him. He thinks often of women in his own community like Bernadette Anderson, Liz Samual, Liz Moore, and Willa Mae Dixon. He remembered John Jacobs, an older peer Moss called his “first role model” and Ray Wells, his boxing coach who taught him not to drink or smoke, to keep a clear head. He spoke at length about Mahmoud El-Kati, a renowned former university professor and community elder who first taught him his “true history.” 
“All of them carried me a long way and I had the sense to listen,” Moss said. 
El-Kati was among the many speakers at the Tuesday street renaming. The now retired professor said he met Moss in 1966 as a young man. He described him as a man “with undying love for his people” and part of a “long, long, long line of Black traditional prophets.” 
“We have been blessed as a people with love warriors – from Fredrick Douglas to Marvin Nelson and Fannie Lou Hamer,” El-Kati said. These prophets, he said,  had a clear mission: “Stand up, speak loud, tell the truth, shame the devil, live free … You are heir to that. That was handed down to you.” 




Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Council Member Jeremiah Ellison speaking during the dedication of Spike Moss Way on Tuesday.
 
Those who came after 
When Attorney General Keith Ellison stood in front of a microphone on April 21 of 2021 to address the Derek Chauvin verdict in the murder of George Floyd, Ellisoin said, “My mind was in many places, but it really was on one person who made such a big difference in my life and that was Spike Moss. The reason I was thinking about Spike Moss was because the first person who ever taught me that you can organize, work and actually –  not just fight for justice – but actually win some accountability.”  
Before George Floyd, Ellison, who met Moss when he was 22 years old, remembers Moss organizing protests after 17-year-old Tycel Nelson was killed by a police officer in 1990. Ellison remembers Moss protesting police brutality with Clyde Bellecourt after police drove two Native American men to the hospital in the trunk of a squad car. Ellison remembers numerous protests led by Moss. 
“Spike said, ‘Come on, y’all, we’re not going to be quiet, we’re going to raise our voices, we’re going to demand justice,’” Ellison said. “We’re not going to back down. And the issue is not whether we win or lose, we’re going to fight. We’re going to stand up and one of these days we are going to get one (a conviction against a police officer).” 
The attorney general thanked Moss on behalf of his entire family. Ellison’s son, Ward 5 Minneapolis City Councilman Jeremiah Ellison, also spoke at the street renaming. He wanted to be clear, he doesn’t know Moss from his work as a council member. Rather, he knows him from his youth. 
“I’ve known you my whole life and the work that you’ve done in this community is not only not lost on me, but I’ve internalized it,” Jeremiah Ellison said.

Just after noon one cloudy Sunday, Burnsville resident Fay Li found herself in a study room at the Burnhaven library studying for an exam to become a registered nurse. 
The library, however, wouldn’t open for another hour. Li got access to the library as part of initiatives by two south metro libraries, called Extended Access, to allow patrons access to facilities during hours when the building is officially closed and when staff isn’t present. 
Fourteen such libraries in Dakota and Scott County are accessible to patrons with pre-registration, with the Galaxie library in Apple Valley and the Savage library being accessible as of this month. One more library branch each in Dakota and Scott County will be accessible after-hours later this summer. 
 


 


For Li, who commuted from Shakopee to the Burnhaven library before relocating just to take advantage of extended access hours, it’s given her time to study for the exam. 
“One time I was just coming here to study and I really wanted to stay. One of the leaders said we have self access hours,” Li said.

Full after-hours access years in the making
Scott County began its foray in making its libraries accessible in off hours shortly after the Great Recession of 2008. County officials said they made their library meeting rooms accessible off-hours between 2009 and 2010. 
Scott County Library officials say the response to off-hours meeting room use inspired them to provide access to other library resources. 
 


 


“The positive response to after-hours meeting room use inspired SCL (Scott County Libraries) to consider how we could similarly provide access to other desirable resources like Wi-Fi, computers, and study spaces,” Scott County spokesperson Lisa Kohner said. 
From 2018 to 2019, Scott County worked with the University of Minnesota’s 
Resilient Communities Project
 to determine how to increase library access. The collaboration was part of a larger county effort to implement its 2040 comprehensive plan goals, which was crafted under the same state law that mandated 
Minneapolis’ controversial comprehensive plan
. 
Through the Resilient Communities Project collaboration, a research team of St. Catherine University library science students found enthusiastic interest in 
libraries open to the public beyond staffed hours
, particularly from those who live in Jordan, a town off of Highway 169 10 miles southwest of Shakopee.
Scott County Libraries launched extended access at the Jordan library in September 2021, making it accessible to those with a registered library card from the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Since its launch, the branch has seen 11,619 extended-hours visitors. The Scott County library system has 1,370 registered users as of June 25.

Meanwhile, Dakota County Libraries launched extended access at the Farmington library early last year, making it accessible to users from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. County spokesperson Mary Beth Schubert said it started with Farmington because the branch had limited hours and “the need for more access was greatest there.” Since its launch, 2,737 people have registered to access libraries countywide after hours.  
Scott County soon began to expand to other branch locations, including to New Prague in June of 2023. Extended hours usage at the New Prague branch soared since it started, doubling from 122 visits in June of 2023 to 255 in May of this year. The New Prague library has the second-highest off-hours visits among Scott County libraries, after the library in Jordan.

During a recent four-hour visit to the New Prague library on a Friday afternoon, when it is closed, a MinnPost reporter saw a group of homeschooled children playing with toys in a meeting room, as well as people coming and going to browse books and use computers. 
Jennifer A., a New Prague resident who declined to share her last name with MinnPost for privacy reasons, was one of those patrons.
 


 


 “I don’t have internet access so that’s why I come here,” said Jennifer, adding she has a very old computer.
The initiative costs Scott County $20,000 per branch annually, which includes software, security measures such as cameras, and staff time. For Dakota County, it spent $275,000 for security cameras, speakers for automated announcements, building modifications, and software adjustments, and plans to spend $150,000 annually on energy costs and utilities for all 10 locations. 
“Ongoing software costs and staff time to support the process are needed whether we offer this service or not,” Dakota County spokesperson Mary Beth Schubert added. 
Despite the lack of staff present off hours, Scott County librarian Kristy Rieger believes the initiative will require more staff, not less. 
 


 


“Reducing staff would counterintuitively erode both the user experience and the sustainability of SCL’s overall operations. Many SCL, city, and county partners are working behind the scenes to ensure visitors have a great experience, regardless of when they visit the library. Long term, we expect extended access to gradually increase the need for staff, contingent on impacts to basic operations (shelving, item processing, etc.) and community demands for programming,” Rieger said. 
How to get extended access
Nine of 10 Dakota County library branches are now accessible for extended hours, with the Galaxie library in Apple Valley joining the roster on July 8. Dakota County expects the Wentworth Branch library in West St. Paul to be accessible sometime in August. 
 


 


Meanwhile, five of seven Scott County library branches are accessible off-hours, with the addition of the Savage library on July 1. The county expects to make the Prior Lake branch accessible sometime in September.
Scott County library officials have no immediate plans to make its Shakopee branch accessible for extended hours. 
“As our largest branch, and our only branch with two floors, the Shakopee Library would likely require extensive and costly facility modifications to safely support extended access. As a result, we felt it best to pause and revisit Shakopee at a later date,” Rieger said, adding they increased staffed hours at Shakopee library in March 2024.
Securing access to a Dakota or Scott County library is relatively simple. A person first needs to have a library card from a 
Minnesota regional library system
, which includes any library in the Twin Cities. They then need to register the library card in-person at a library associated with the system you wish to use after hours. They will also need to bring a state-issued identification card so library staff can verify the person’s identity.

After a library card is registered with their system, a person will need to 
review
 a 
video
 about the service, as well as complete an access form. The access form for Dakota County libraries can be 
completed online
, while the access form for Scott County must be completed in-person. 
Rieger expects for patrons to obtain extended hours access on the same day they sign up. Indeed, the MinnPost reporter was granted extended hours access at Scott County Libraries the same day they registered their existing Hennepin County library card with the system last November. Meanwhile, Dakota County library officials expect to take one to three weeks to process applications for extended access, though the MinnPost writer was able to receive a proximity card to access Dakota County libraries in a little more than a week after registering their Hennepin County library card with Dakota County. 
After-hours access elsewhere
In September, Hennepin County libraries converted its Osseo branch library into a self-service branch. Once open three days a week, the library is now open when Osseo City Hall is open.
Marnie Schuster, a Maple Grove resident, found herself visiting the Osseo City Hall to make copies one Monday in July. With the Osseo library open more often, Schuster thinks she may start visiting more. 
“It’s right by my kids’ high school,” said Schuster. 
Hennepin County Library also allows users to pick up reserved books at the Arvonne Fraser and Ridgedale libraries during certain hours when the library is not open. Holds at these libraries are kept in a separate room and can be accessed by scanning a library card. 
Meanwhile, both the Carver County Library and Great River Regional Library systems, the latter serving central Minnesota, are considering following in Dakota and Scott County’s footsteps in allowing their patrons to use their libraries during off hours. 
For the Great River Regional Library, it has not decided where to start the pilot. Because some of its libraries are located in city facilities, those cities would have to approve the pilot. 
“It is too soon for us to name the specific location. We are discussing possible locations and will need city approval in order to move forward,” Executive Director Karen Pundsack said in an e-mail. 
Libraries in Anoka, Carver and Washington counties, as well as the St. Paul Public Library, have lockers available for those who wish to pick up library materials either outside of library hours or outside of library facilities. For example, Carver County has three such lockers in municipal buildings in Cologne, Mayer, and Victoria, as well as one additional set of lockers at Southwest Transit’s Carver Station. The four Carver County lockers combined have a total circulation of 10,317 in 2023.

When the future of Uber and Lyft in Minnesota was still uncertain, a plethora of rideshare alternative companies and one co-op looked to launch in the Twin Cities. 
Only two prevailed. 
St. Paul-based startup MyWeels and Austin-based rideshare chain Wridz launched in Minneapolis in May. More might still launch later in the year. This month, a steering committee for a Twin Cities-based rideshare co-op announced plans to launch, though details remain sparse at this time. 
Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the state on July 1 
if driver pay rates rose to what a Minneapolis ordinance would have required
. But negotiations and a new state law signed by Gov. Walz prevented their departure, though minimum pay rates will rise in the state starting in December. 
 


 


Despite the country’s two major rideshare players remaining, the alternative companies don’t plan on going anywhere. 
MyWeels: finding a market niche 
MyWeels is the only true Minnesota startup rideshare company to come out of Uber and Lyft’s threat to leave the state. While MyWheels saw an uptick in app downloads and driver applications during the uncertainty, the company didn’t experience the tremendous growth they might have if Uber and Lyft had left, said MyWeels founder Elam Baer. 
Baer prepared for the possibility that Uber and Lyft would stay, however, and is confident that MyWeels will find its own niche in the market.
“We kind of suspected that they would stay,” Baer said. 
 


 


Rather than trying to directly compete with Uber and Lyft, Baer said MyWeels is looking to specifically cater to customers who cannot drive or don’t have a driver’s license. 
“In other words, people for whom transportation is more of a necessity than convenience,” he said. “There are an awful lot of people in the state who do not have driver’s licenses, and they don’t for a whole variety of reasons.”

The company is building audience by including services Uber and Lyft don’t typically provide. For example, a MyWeels rider can request a round-trip service where a driver will bring a passenger to a location and be ready to return that same passenger to their original location.

The company is also working to build a “driver-centric” platform that allows each driver to build their own customer-base. Riders can name drivers as their “favorites” and get first pick on whether or not they’ll accept a ride from that customer when one is requested. 
 


 


Moving forward, Baer is looking to introduce a lower-cost service that includes multiple passenger pickup. He said this would look similar to a quasi-bus service but with door-to-door pickup instead of passengers needing to walk to a bus stop. 
“We can’t realistically take on Uber and Lyft to develop the kind of name ID that they have developed over the years,” Baer said. “We think we can develop a service offering for certain market niches.”
MyWeels has about 250 drivers. Baer says the trick is “finding the sweet spot” in the driver to customer ratio. 
“What we really don’t want to happen is to have a whole bunch of riders and no customers for them,” he said. 
 


 


Most drivers for MyWeels are also Uber and Lyft drivers. But Baer said MyWeels is already paying drivers more than what the increased rate will be come December. 
“It’s worthwhile for them to keep the app going and to keep working for MyWeels, because it’s an incremental benefit to them with really no out of pocket costs,” Baer said. 
Wridz: an alternative business model 
Unlike MyWeels, Wridz was already a well-established rideshare alternative to Uber and Lyft before launching in the Twin Cities market in May.
Where MyWeels is working to differentiate itself through its services rendered, Wridz has prevailed as a nation-wide alternative because of its unique business model. Instead of Wridz taking a percentage of a driver’s fare, the driver pays a monthly $100 subscription fee for the app and gets to keep all of the money earned after completing a ride. 
 


 


Minneapolis was Wridz’s 22nd market and co-founder and CEO Steve Wright said the company is still onboarding new drivers each day.

“What we’ve learned is the drivers who are truly independent contractors and are more of the entrepreneur, really excel in rides,” Wright said. “You can build a clientele with Wridz. You can get repeat requests. We found the drivers who do the best are the ones who are recruiting and actually getting their own clientele and doing repeat trips.”
Wright said his goal in the Twin Cities is to prove his company is really working for drivers first. He said the main thing that stuck out from his experience in the Twin Cities was that people were very friendly, which Wright believes is good for business.

“I think the main thing is that passengers need to realize that what they pay for the trip – very, very, very little of that eventually makes it into the driver (with other models),” he said “I think once passengers realize that all the other rideshare companies are going to excel.” 
A possible co-op 
A rideshare co-op remains in the works and tentatively plans to launch later this year, though specifics on what this will look like are limited. A steering committee made up of four drivers and a community organizer is currently working out the details of the endeavor.  
The group is working on its business plan with the help of Nexus Community Partners and the Metropolitan Consortium of Community Developers. It has also received a grant from the Bush Foundation. The group declined to comment on the amount of the grant.

Drivers began talking about launching their own company under a cooperative model in March when Uber and Lyft were still threatening departure from at least Minneapolis. At the time, Erik Forman, a co-founder of the Drivers Cooperative in New York came to Minnesota to speak about launching a rideshare co-op. He said drivers would need to raise at least around 
$200,000 to get a co-op off the ground
.
Despite these hurdles, many drivers remain determined to create a rideshare network that’s self-run. No drivers working with the co-op were available to speak for this story, but they did provide comments in a recent news release. Layla Ibrahim, a driver on the Co-op Formation Committee said in the statement, “We own the cars, we serve the customers, we do the work. Why shouldn’t we own the business and make the decisions about it?”  
Driver Ahmed Ismail worked as a certified public accountant for decades. He wrote that he is excited to bring his skills to a co-op business model. 
“We have so many drivers in this community with expertise in finance, app development, or small businesses,” Ismail said. “We don’t need to rely on companies that don’t care about us, and don’t care about riders. We’re creating a business that uses democracy, where drivers share responsibility and share any profits that we make together.”

At their simplest, vacancy rates are calculated by adding the total rentable square footage in office buildings divided by the total amount of space. And yet, different firms who publish vacancy rates rarely come up with the same figures.
For the first quarter of 2024, 
Colliers
 published an overall vacancy of 12.3% for St. Paul’s central business district. 
Avison Young
 said 19.1%, while 
Cushman & Wakefield
 reported 27%. The 
St. Paul Building Owners and Managers Association
’s (BOMA) had the highest rate at 31.5%, even though that group initially reported a much lower figure.
How can four sources produce such wildly different figures for the same area? To start, not everyone has the same definition of downtown, or any other local region, for that matter.
 


 


“It gets a lot more complicated as you start thinking about all of the nuances of different building types and classes, geography,” said Jesse Tollison, a research analyst at Colliers.
When defining geographic markets, each of the firms used major corridors as guidelines for classifying central business districts. Avison Young relies on the local expertise of their brokers as well as borders based on interstate highways, said analyst Joe Stockman.

Cushman & Wakefield considers St. Paul’s central business district to be the area blocked off by I-35E, I-94, West Kellogg Boulevard and encompasses the office buildings immediately across the Mississippi River, said director Patrick Hamilton. Office buildings outside of those boundaries are grouped separately because they are more likely to compete with suburban office buildings in Roseville, Maplewood, and Shoreview.
“Everybody’s got different boundaries of where they think the competitive metro geography ends,” Hamilton said.

Aside from geography, firms sometimes use different source material. Commercial real estate listing services like CoStar and Catalyst, for instance, are valuable resources for finding actual vacancies, Tollison said. Brokers with the company are often in the know about upcoming vacancies, but news articles and reaching out to businesses directly are also helpful, he added.
Tollison said he and other researchers are invited to be part of the Minnesota Commerical Association of Realtors’ Research Advisory Board, through which analysts call every financial quarter and exchange information about vacancy and absorption.

Avison Young relies on a “mixed bag of sources” to get an accurate representation of the market, from brokers’ conversations with property managers to articles, press releases, rent rolls, and subscription-based listing services, said market analyst Joe Stockman.
Cushman & Wakefield looks at data from subscription-based listing services, but it uses the data as “guideposts” rather than including it in quarterly reports, said Director Patrick Hamilton. Almost all of its numbers come from reaching out to brokers and checking the accuracy of availability, square footage, and move-out dates.
 


 


Hamilton said the firm has internal quarterly meetings going over vacancies, leases, and availabilities, ensuring that all information is consistent.
As a smaller organization, BOMA prides itself on community and tends to be more hands on, said President Tina Glassman.
BOMA began using Catalyst last year to track vacancies, but prior to that, most of the information was gleaned from directly asking property managers how much available space they had, Glassman said. The change has given BOMA more credibility, but the organization continues to double check accuracy with property managers or brokers.
“There’s always a risk in self-reporting,” Glassman said.
 


 


 


 


Axios
 reported 
Madison Equities did not inform BOMA of 610,000 square feet of vacant office space
, making downtown St. Paul’s vacancy rate 31.5%, not 22.5% published in BOMA’s annual report.
BOMA includes a caveat with its reports that it includes self-reported information, but Glassman said Madison Equities is not a member and does not have the same relationship as other building owners.

Colliers’ quarterly report accounts for buildings with more 10,000 square feet, bringing its vacancy rate lower than competitors, Tollison said. Smaller buildings tend to have much higher occupancy rates and are more likely to only have one tenant, he said.
Cushman & Wakefield tracks buildings with more than 20,000 square feet because it becomes more difficult to track, and smaller buildings tend to be mixed-use, making the office component of those buildings less competitive, said Director Patrick Hamilton.
 


 


Avison Young’s cutoff is 15,000 square feet because anything lower is less relevant to the market, said analyst Joe Stockman.
Including owner-occupied properties is another factor that drives up vacancy rates, particularly at a time when companies are reevaluating how much space they really need, Tollison said. Colliers includes properties like the Blue Cross Blue Shield, Thompson Reuters, and Best Buy campuses, 
all of which have recently downsized their previously single-tenant offices
, because they are relevant to the market in terms of their sales and redevelopment, he said.
Stockman said including owner-user properties gives Avison Young a “pretty comprehensive capture” of the market though they do temper vacancy rates as they are 100% occupied.
Cushman & Wakefield plans to track single tenant buildings starting in the first quarter of 2025, also because of the volume of corporate office space available on the market coming out of the pandemic, Hamilton said.
Sublet vacancies are trending down because people wanted out of their pandemic leases as they reassess the amount of space they need, but now the subletters are taking over the lease and changing the rates, Stockman said.
“Since the pandemic, we’ve seen a lot of interesting movement and vacancy numbers just because of the need for office space, the need catering to your hybrid workforce and your return to office policies,” he said.
Colliers reports on direct and overall vacancies, as distinguishing between the two can push rates up: if a tenant subleases half of their space, overall vacancy would reflect that change, Tollison said.

Last week, St. Paul leaders Mayor Melvin Carter and Public Works Director Sean Kershaw announced a new contract for the city’s solid waste, something that was just a gleam in a bureaucrat’s eye a decade ago, before St. Paul had any form of municipal garbage operations. 
The news this time is that St. Paul chose a single hauler, 
FCC Environmental
, for citywide waste collection beginning in April 2025. A huge municipal services company founded in Spain in the early 20th century, FCC operates garbage trucks in cities all over the world, and has recently been expanding into the U.S. Midwest. 
The key to the new contract is that St. Paul will supplement FCC’s service with a 
first-ever city-owned truck fleet
 of five garbage trucks, set to be delivered in December. (I’m hoping for a naming contest and city-flag livery.) The city’s new trucks will operate in the most challenging terrain, the 10% of the streets with narrow alleys or high percentage of rental housing, simplifying the rest of the bid.
 


 


It’s all a big deal if you think back to the infamous 2019 “garbage wars,” when voters 
held a referendum
 on whether or not the city of St. Paul, with a population of over 300,000 people, should keep its nascent “organized” system for how it collected trash. 
It passed handily
.
I look back on the great trash wars with fondness. It’s almost charming that something 
as mundane and common sense as organizing trash collection
 was the main issue people were fighting over, instead of more existential and difficult questions like policing, housing, COVID, or climate change.

The birth of ‘consortium’ trash collection
Still, the balance over basic civics seemed delicate for years. In a fig leaf to small-scale politics, when then-Mayor Chris Coleman began planning organized trash collection in 2016, his team decided that the best move for organized trash then was not to choose one individual company. Instead, they worked with the dozen or so small businesses that had been servicing the city, albeit inefficiently, for decades. Thus “the consortium” was born, a round table of 14 small companies that divvied the city into dedicated turf, much like 18th century colonial empires or 20th century mob boss clichés.
This was probably good politics. After all, the anti-trash campaign had centered their campaign on the image of the small business, even invoking the ironic slogan to “hug your hauler” and oppose the organization scheme. But the awkward arrangement with so many companies, often leading nowhere, eventually had to cede ground to a more streamlined situation.
 


 


“Having one hauler, not from an economic perspective, but it does make negotiating easier. You have one company with one agenda instead of 3-4-5,” admitted Kershaw, the public works director whose department oversees solid waste.
One problem with the consortium system was that individual small companies routinely sold their routes and turf to larger competitors in private business deals. This meant that the trash landscape slowly consolidated as more and more of the city’s territory was acquired by big companies like Texas-based Waste Management. Eventually, there were only three small companies left.
Toward zero waste?
The consortium contract expired last year, and the city moved ahead with a new request for proposals. Officially, the city left room for groups of companies to apply for the new contract, but according to Kershaw, nobody did. Only single haulers submitted applications, and the city chose the lowest cost, best bid. 
That didn’t leave much room for small companies to compete with the big corporations, and some operators remain upset about it.
 


 


“It’s disheartening that the city opted to choose an international hauler, when [it] had two local, family owned haulers submitting bids,” said Bob Stewart, head of operations at Vermillion-based 
Highland Sanitation
, who submitted a bid of its own. “We have two routes in St. Paul and about five employees whose jobs are directly tied to those routes. We’ll need to either eliminate, or try to repurpose those jobs into different routes.”
 


 


According to Kershaw, FCC was the only bid that abided by all the city’s goals and benchmarks. The resulting situation — one hauler with city support — opens up new territory for what solid waste might look like, especially around some other operational details.

“I didn’t like the residential collection program as it was outlined,” said Sarah Haas, who heads the Solid Waste program for the city. “It was focused on collection, and I want it to be about diversion.”
The good news is that the new contract offers St. Paul a chance to start reducing its waste stream. Compared to the petty days of the trash wars, it seems the stuff of science fiction. For example, one winner under the new system will be the “zero waste” folks, easily the most sympathetic anti-trash folks from the 2019 years. For people who attempt to reduce trash consumption to zero (or close enough), they’ll now be able to opt out of the system altogether, which will surely be welcome news.
 


 


Curbing illegal dumping
The other big solution on the horizon involves dumping, where scofflaws unload large trash items — mattresses, old couches, used tires — on any vacant land in order to avoid dump fees. This has long been a problem in St. Paul’s economically or topographically challenged neighborhoods, anywhere with a vacant lot or a neglected stretch of river bluff. Talking to neighbors in my old West Side neighborhood, the middle-of-the-night appearance of an old couch had been a constant, dispiriting nuisance.

After the organization scheme, there had been hopes that the new system would alleviate that problem. Anecdotally anyway, dumping has remained an issue, but that might change.
“The new contract reduces the burden for residents who are illegally dumped on,” explained Haas.
In the past, residents had to call ahead and arrange pickups of couches or Christmas trees with their dozen or so individual contractors.  For many, that proved a step too far. The new system matches what’s done in Minneapolis. People simply leave bulk items out by their bins, and in theory anyway, either the city or FCC will take it away.

“I’m super optimistic about it already,” Haas said. “I’m hearing positive feedback from residents. People do not want to have to schedule bulky items. [Instead,] you put it out on your trash day and it will be collected.”
Building on these innovations, Haas and her colleagues aim to actually start reducing the waste stream as well, with the county eventually adding organic compost collection in the next two years. The city’s official goal is to evaluate and adapt with FCC, using benchmarks and reducing annual waste collected by 2% each year.
So long, consortium era. Few people are likely to remember it.

The Twin Cities on Tuesday became the seventh city in the country to host an economic summit for Asian-American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities with federal resources under President Joe Biden’s “Investing in America” agenda. 
Held at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, the event drew a large crowd and focused on linking immigrants with federal support to promote economic growth and inclusivity. Similar summits have been held in Philadelphia, Chicago, Seattle, New York City, Honolulu and Atlanta.
U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-5th District, and her family arrived in Minnesota when they immigrated from Somalia and Kenya nearly 30 years ago. Elected to the House in 2018, she hopes to provide the next generation of immigrants with “great opportunities to achieve the American dream.”

“I’m glad that folks that are not from Minnesota have the opportunity today to be here with us to see the opportunities that Minnesota offers to take lessons from us that can be implemented in which we continue to thrive and utilize every opportunity that we have to create a more inclusive and welcoming society,” Omar said.
The event was hosted in partnership with several federal agencies, including the U.S. Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as the National Asian and Pacific Islander American Chamber of Commerce and Entrepreneurship and state and local leaders.

United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Deputy SBA Administrator Dilawar Syed were among the officials who attended. 
“This is one area where the growth and the development of [the community], economically and politically, and its leaders across the board is really strong,” Tai said. “It’s a part of pushing ourselves to leave the comfort of Washington to come out and connect with our fellow Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders and to learn and educate us on how we can make our policies more responsive and more effective.”
 


 


 


 


Participants could gather materials at several tables that were set up about various programs or companies. White House leaders and government figures spoke to the summit attendees in the auditorium, sharing ways immigrants can access federal jobs, grants and programs. 
The Minnesota summit saw one of its biggest turnouts in attendance compared to previous summits, primarily with its target group in the Asian-American community. 
“Today’s summit is actually the result of a recommendation that our President’s Advisory Commission made to the president, encouraging the administration to ensure that we could better connect our local communities, small business owners, entrepreneurs, and our community leaders with critical federal resources to ensure that they have the capital the the information and the resources that they need to thrive,” said Krystal Ka’ai, executive director for the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.
In addition to helping immigrants, the event was also designed to provide information to local businesses who can then inform others about these opportunities. 
 


 


Syed said past events brought the community together through learning opportunities from the government. He noted that the Biden-Harris Administration would need to wait several years to accurately assess the effectiveness of its summits, as communities require time to become reliable indicators of the impact.
“This is why we’re here, to talk about this and make sure that in the long term we can have a measurable impact,” Syed said. “We want local leaders to step up. Make sure that they are connecting with our local population and local entrepreneur communities.”

Claire Tralle’s Minneapolis Public Schools’ student, Hary, came out as nonbinary in kindergarten. 
It was 2020 when they came out and classes were still being held on Zoom. But, a year later when in-person classes resumed, Tralle says Hary faced constant misgendering and confusion. They didn’t see themselves in the gendered language used by MPS faculty and staff. 
“Staff and educators would say, ‘OK, boys on this side, girls on this side …’  as a nonbinary individual, when you’re only hearing ‘boys’ and ‘girls,’ that feels very othering,” Tralle said.
 


 


Tralle doesn’t believe most teachers or staff were being malicious when this happened. Without a district-wide uniform policy, many simply did not have the knowledge or understanding to work with gender-diverse students, she said. 
“Language and understanding is constantly evolving,” Tralle said. “Even people within the queer community or sexuality educators or other ‘in the know’ people; it’s still evolving and changing for us.” 
This past month, the MPS Board of Education unanimously passed a district-wide gender inclusion policy, expanding support for the district’s transgender and nonbinary youth. This policy was crafted and advocated for by Tralle and other parents of trans and nonbinary children.
Some key points in the policy include: 
 


 


Elementary schools are now required to change a student’s name and pronouns upon request at any grade level, not just starting in 6th grade. 


All schools are required to provide improved bathroom access for transgender and non-binary students, including more accessible all-gender bathrooms that are not locked or hidden away. 


It implements requirements for staff to receive continued education on gender identity issues. Notably, there are no specific details on when or how often this training happens.  The details on this will be left to the district’s superintendent’s discretion.
While the policy was passed unanimously by the MPS school board, Tralle noted it should not have taken until 2024 for a uniform gender inclusion policy to be implemented in the district.
“I think that a lot of people assumed, because we’re Minneapolis and because we’re a progressive city, of course this must have already existed,” Tralle said. 
St. Paul passed a gender inclusion policy in 2015. Tralle said St. Paul’s policy was very short compared to the MPS policy. “I think that was reflective of 2015,” she said.
The politicization of trans youth
In 2023, Gov. Tim Walz signed a transgender refuge bill into law, which protects gender affirming care for transgender youth in the state and coming into the state to receive it. Refuge bills were also passed in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Washington and Vermont and Washington, D.C. 
 


 


These protections were adopted as anti-trans bills exploded across the country over the past few years. Trans Legislation Tracker, an independent research organization tracking bills that impact trans and gender-diverse people across the United States, is tracking 
more than 617 bills, more than any other year on record. 
States have already passed 44 bills in 2024. In 2023, 87 bills passed, compared to 26 bills passed in 2022 and 18 passed in 2021.

These bills include legislation limiting gender affirming practices in schools and restrictions on transgender participation in athletic programing. As of May 2024, 25 states have passed bans on gender-affirming care for teenage students.
“It is more dangerous to be trans – especially a trans youth – now than it was five or 10 years ago because the GOP has decided to make this a political issue,” Tralle said. “It never needed to be a political issue. These are just kids trying to exist and go to school and play soccer and be themselves.”
As transgender youth and adults have been increasingly politicized, cases violence and hate against LGBTQ+ youth have also risen. In states with anti LGBTQ+ laws, schools hate crimes have quadrupled, according to a 
Washington Post analysis of FBI data
. Nationwide, hate crimes against LGBTQ+ youth reported to the FBI doubled in 2021 and 2022 as compared to 2015-2019. While states with protections remaining for this population of youth had less of an increase in these crimes, there still was an increase.
 


 


Continued education around gender inclusion 
Gender inclusion protections at all levels of community including in state and local governments, along with in schools, have become increasingly important as gender identity has become increasingly politicized, said Aliya Finman-Palmer, director of Educational Equity for 
OutFront Minnesota
, a nonprofit that supports LGBTQ+ communities across the state. 
As attacks and legislation against gender expansive youth have increased, more and more school districts across the state have sought help from OutFront as they look to adopt their own gender inclusion policies, Finman-Palmer said. School districts like St. Paul and Duluth have already adopted policies and OutFront is currently working with districts including Bloomington and Rochester.

Finman-Palmer is hopeful that more schools will continue to look into these policies. 
“As more districts adopt these policies, it means that more and more kids have stability in school and the support that they need in these spaces,” she said. 
 


 


A large component of these policies includes offering training for school district staff. OutFront offers more than a dozen trainings both in-person and online on a range of topics, including LGBTQIA+ 101, which covers terminology and basic concepts. 
Notably, gender inclusion policies are not only for queer and trans students, Finman-Palmer said. 
“If you are coming into a school building and you’re a parent of a child or a caregiver of a child of different gender than yourself, you’re able to go into the facility and be in there for what any needs might be,” she said. “So this also helps with disability access.” 
Parents behind the policy 
Parents, students and teachers were ultimately the ones who pushed to get a gender inclusion policy on the books for MPS. 
 


 


It is important that children are able to not only explore and acknowledge their own identity, but also be believed by adults as they do so, said Nicole Gehle, a parent of a nonbinary MPS student and a first grade teacher with the district. 
“If they are telling us something about themselves then we should believe them,” Gehle said. “That’s how we want to support them and care for them, and if they change and grow, we’ll love them also. Just like adults change and grow, kids should be allowed to too.” 
The policy is also an important step for allyship, Gehle said. Seeing unanimous support for the policy from the school board was in itself encouraging. This also helps create a space where kids can support their peers. 
“It’s not only creating a mirror for students who need that support, it’s also creating a window for students to be able to see how we respect everyone,” Gehle said.

Minneapolis has long had a reputation for being a hub to LGBTQ+ folks across the Midwest and beyond. This is what brought Anna Ehl and their family to the Twin Cities. Only a few years ago, the family moved from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to Minneapolis to be in a more inclusive environment.
“As it happened, it was very lucky that we made that choice because part way through my child’s kindergarten year they let us know that they’re non binary,” Ehl said. “Where we had been living before would not have been a very welcoming environment to that identity. We felt really relieved that we made a good choice for our kid.”
But even in a community praised for its inclusiveness, Ehl’s child still was bullied on the playground, often violently, the parent said. When Ehl reached out to the school’s social worker, the conversation didn’t lead to any improvement. After going to the school’s principal Ehl’s child was transferred to a different school, but Ehl said it was clear more needed to be done to keep students safe.

“So that was a catalyzing moment for me where I was like, I need to be a lot more involved in what’s happening at school,” Ehl said. 
Soon, Ehl met Tralle. The two set up an after school gay-straight alliance for LGBTQ+ students and were part of the group of parents who continued to advocate for and help draft the gender inclusion policy that passed.  
Ehl hopes this policy can help LGBTQ+ children grow up in a safer environment where they can truly be themselves. According to a national 
survey by The Trevor Project
, the number of LGBTQ+ youth facing suicidal thoughts has increased over the past few years. 
“For me, it boils down to this: Maybe my child will always be gender diverse,” Ehl said. “Maybe my child will continue to be gender fluid through their whole life. Maybe they won’t. Maybe at some point, they’ll feel comfortable in the gender they were born in. Maybe at some point, they’ll feel comfortable settling in another gender. It’s not really up to me, and it doesn’t really matter, because what my job is is to love and support the child who’s in front of me.”

I’ve been around the block enough times to take any appearance of “city rankings” with a healthy dose of skepticism. Most of these listicles sit on thin foundations, based on contingent search terms or highly subjective and incoherent criteria. Still, it’s hard not to fall for lists that put Minneapolis or St. Paul at No. 1 in the country: say, Minneapolis having the “
best park system
”, Woodbury being the No. 9 “
best place to live
” (via Money Magazine) or (the most egregious claim of all) or St. Paul’s brief run as “
most livable city
” (via something called Smart Asset). 
This is why I have mixed feelings when I saw the latest rankings from bicycling advocacy group,
 People for Bikes
. Their
 most recent annual report
 garnered headlines 
in the Star Tribune
 and elsewhere, declaring Minneapolis to be the best big city for bicycling in the U.S.
On one hand, I’m happy Minneapolis gets recognized for investments in bicycle infrastructure. On the other hand, being named best large bike city in the U.S. isn’t much of a compliment, and threatens to give people the wrong impression. The truth is, even though we’re on the right track, Minneapolis is not yet close to the top tier of world bicycling cities.
 


 


Flawed data
The People for Bikes list is particularly misleading because it claims to have solid quantitative data. It even has an acronym shorthand for their methodology (
SPRINT
), which is how you know they take it seriously. Its resulting chart purports to explain fine-tuned progress comparing cities around the world on a 100-point scale. For example, Minneapolis scores a 71, the best in a U.S. city over 300,000 population, alongside other global cities like Rotterdam, Netherlands (72), Bogotá, Colombia (71) or Lisbon, Portugal (70).

To be fair, People for Bikes admits its data is flawed, even including “Trusted Data” as one of the report’s key criteria. This reflects the fact that it’s a challenge to collect data on cycling compared to motor vehicles, which can easily be counted using simple technologies. Most cities don’t have much information about cycling numbers, and coming up with ways to compare places across the wide spectrum of geography and regulation seems like a fool’s errand.
Also to be fair, it is defensible to claim that Minneapolis is the best large bicycling city in the United States. The low bar is low, as it says, and Minneapolis beats its next highest competitors, Seattle and San Francisco, by six points. Minneapolis bicycling benefits greatly from its riverfront network – especially the two Mississippi River boulevards – and its off-street trails like the Midtown Greenway.

But that’s not really what these rankings purport to say. Instead, Minneapolis’ high score is based almost completely on its recent reduction of citywide speed limits. You may recall that,
 back in 2020
, Minneapolis and St. Paul launched a 20 miles per hour default speed limit policy, with ubiquitous blue signs yard signs. That’s the reason why Minneapolis score shot up from a 37 to a 71, seemingly overnight; under People For Bikes’ model, that instantly qualified most Minneapolis streets as “low stress.”
 


 


The problem is that posted speed limits have
 only a marginal impact on driver behavior
, and the degree of stress involved with bicycling down South 31st Street hasn’t changed. Thanks to
 the rise in post-COVID reckless driving
, Minneapolis streets are arguably more dangerous now for cyclists than they were before speed limits were lowered. It’s not that lowering speed limits is bad, but that evaluations like this offer precision without accuracy.
Apples to oranges
Where the rankings really fail is when it jumps into international comparisons, putting Minneapolis and other European or Asian countries on similar scales. Frankly, this is pretty silly. 
Take Rotterdam, for example, famously the most car-dependent city in the Netherlands and effectively tied on the People for Bikes scale with Minneapolis. The similar scores massively understate the on-the-ground difference between a city like Minneapolis and one like Rotterdam. 
In their influential book “
Building the Cycling City
,” Melissa and Chris Bruntlett describe Rotterdam as one of the fastest improving cities in the Netherlands, a place that’s made transformational investments and removed thousands of central city parking places on purpose, simply to shift transportation behavior. 
 


 


 


 


For example, a standard Rotterdam protected bike lane, like the ones along main busy roads (e.g. Westblaak or Schiedamsedijk) features an entirely at-grade path (lacking curbs), is far better protected from vehicles than almost any Minneapolis bike route, and has the kind of separated and signalized intersections practically impossible to build in the U.S. Even Minneapolis’ best bike routes – say the nascent network along downtown’s Washington or 4th Avenues – don’t hold a candle to a Dutch bike street. 
Nothing illustrates this wide gap better than bicycling mode share, the percentage of people who drive, take transit, bike or walk for a trip. Getting this data is admittedly a challenge; for example, the U.S. census only surveys about commuting, trips to work, leaving the vast majority of other trips to school, day care, shopping, or anything else unaccountable. But for commuting, Minneapolis scores about 5%, a level that sadly hasn’t changed much in the last 15 years. By contrast, Rotterdam’s mode share sits around 20% and is growing, four times the level of Minneapolis.

As a result, crowds of people use Rotterdam’s bicycle routes every day, important  because of something planners call the “
safety in numbers
” principle. This is the common sense idea that, compared to safety features like bollards, signals, or reflective vests, the largest factor of detaining bicycle safety is crowds normalizing the expectation that streets are not just for fast-moving, dangerous vehicles. Safety doesn’t simply come through isolated measures like width, but through relationships between people and places.

As a university instructor, I’m quite familiar with the concept of grade inflation. You want to reward students for doing work, and be critical without discouraging them; it’s a fine line. Many of the factors that improve or erode a city’s bicycling experience lie beyond the control of the city itself. America’s poor safety track record stems from widespread subsidies for driving, poor land use spreading out destinations and lack of regulation for vehicle designs combine on top of cultural factors like aggressive driving and lax licensing. Few of these variables are controllable by a municipality, or even state governments.   
 


 


It’s also true that Minneapolis is improving, though the People for Bikes scores don’t really have much to do with that. In places like downtown, if you squint, you can almost get a sense for what Minneapolis low-stress bike network might look like when it’s completed.
 The Bryant Avenue bikeway
 in south Minneapolis has rightly garnered praise, and is on par with a good European design. 
Multiply that route a hundred fold, and Minneapolis might become as safe, comfortable and convenient as one of the world’s top tier bicycling cities. To be the best of the worst is fine, but let’s not celebrate too soon. There’s a long way to go, so let’s circle back in a few decades.

Once separate from downtown, the North Loop neighborhood in Minneapolis is undergoing a vibrant transformation with the opening of North Loop Green, a new mixed-use development that hopes to bring the two neighborhoods together. The project, a collaboration between Pines and Marquee Development, aims to create a lively, year-round space for residents and visitors alike.
At a ribbon cutting ceremony earlier this month, Eric Nordness, the Managing Principal of Marquee Development, talked of the importance of creating more third spaces in the North Loop. “When we look at development, it’s about bringing communities together and giving them great places to gather, to live, to celebrate, and to commune. This is a perfect example of how you get a great neighborhood together and create another perfect third space for people to hang out,” Nordness said.
Reflecting on the area’s past, Katie Andres, event manager at North Loop Green, noted, “It was very bare and a lot of concrete. Traditionally, this space was kind of an area that blocked downtown from North Loop, and so everybody viewed them as two different neighborhoods. The importance of having us here is really bridging that gap in a space that was really underutilized.”

Arriving at North Loop Green is straightforward regardless of whether you’re arriving by foot, car, bicycle, or light rail. The space itself is an expansive open area featuring a green field at its center. Surrounding the field are various places to grab a bite to eat and hang out.
The space is designed for both social gatherings and solitary enjoyment, Andres said.
“There are a lot of restaurants coming in towards the end of summer and early fall, like Purpose Restaurant Group’s Salt and Flour, which is a brand new concept. Most people know them by Hope Breakfast Bar, a favorite that’s coming to downtown Minneapolis for the first time,” Andres said. “Dario is also a favorite, directly adjacent to the green. And Basset Hound is a brand new bar and restaurant where people can grab some small bites and enjoy it outside on the green.”

Anthony Lucken, the general manager of the soon-to-open Salt and Flour, said that North Loop Green is a crucial opportunity to highlight the vibrancy and vitality of Minneapolis. 
 


 


“It’s an opportunity to offer people jobs and show the heart of our city. What was kind of a concrete jungle is now a breath of life,” he said.
North Loop Neighborhood Association President, Diane Merrifield, recalls when North Loop was much smaller in both population and amenities.
 


 


“In 2008, the population was under 700, and today it’s over 10,000. The whole area has just taken off. The neighborhood has been able to regenerate with the repurposing of old historic buildings into residences and businesses,” she explained. Merrifield praised the partnership with North Loop Green, stating, “They are wonderful partners, committed to being part of the neighborhood and doing all kinds of neighborhood events.”
City Council Member Michael Rainville also highlighted the area’s transformation into a more walkable neighborhood that connects to downtown. “There literally is not a single empty building in the North Loop. What was a desolate area 10, 15, 20 years ago is now hitting all sweet spots of live, work, and play. The success is that people don’t need a car to do all three. They can walk to their entertainment, dining, and work. It’s a model for all urban areas to emulate,” he stated.
 


 


Rainville also praised the investment confidence shown by developers in the area. “The developers of North Loop Green have made a $250 million investment. They built a 35-story office tower and a 350-unit apartment building, even without having main tenants initially. Now, the office tower is 70% occupied,” he said.
Basset Hound is a brand new bar and restaurant located at one end of North Loop Green.

North Loop Green is not just about static infrastructure but also about dynamic community engagement, according to Andres. Throughout the month, the space will host a variety of events, including movie nights in the field, exercise classes, and market days with booths for shopping. The aim is to make this a space where people can gather and enjoy activities year-round.
Andres added the community’s involvement has been crucial to the project’s success through the input they provided via surveys. 
“Everyone cares and is interested in what’s taking place, and everyone knows everyone else,” Andres said. “We really have this amazing built-in audience of residents, workers, and just the community in the North Loop in general.”

Is a stretch of sidewalk painted the colors of the rainbow graffiti or art? 
To Richard Moody, an Uptown resident and longtime local producer, fashion designer and artist — it’s art.
During his travels across the world while working as a flight attendant, Moody was inspired by rainbow sidewalks he saw in places like Amsterdam, Iceland, Paris and South Africa. Last year, he had a local artist paint the panels of the sidewalk in front of his Minneapolis East Isles neighborhood home red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. 
 


 


But last month, Moody learned a neighbor filed a complaint with the city, claiming the sidewalk was graffiti. Soon after this, the city had the stretch of rainbow sidewalk mostly stripped. The blue and purple segments remain mostly intact with paint strips littering the gardens around the stretch. 
“They started stripping it one month ago and have not finished it. Now this looks like graffiti,” he said, gesturing to the remaining painted blocks.

Moody is openly gay, but he said the sidewalk was never about that. It was about adding color and brightness to the neighborhood. People would take photos of their kids doing somersaults on the rainbow sidewalk, he said. The same kids would point to a panel and say, “This is my favorite color.” 
“It was just a cute sidewalk,” Moody said.

After the sidewalk was stripped, Moody started a petition to bring it back, which garnered more than 100 signatures. Moody learned recently, however, that the petition isn’t necessary. Rather, he needs to go through multiple steps with the city to have the rainbow paint classified as art and approved for a permit. If approved, he would also need to leave some blank spots on the sidewalk to ensure a slip-free surface, he said.

Moody hired local painter Angela Davis to paint the sidewalk. While some have said the paint could be slippery when wet, causing a safety hazard, he said Davis specifically worked with paints that would not cause this problem.

While Moody waits to go through the city’s process, Davis has painted other parts of his property including three stone staircases, one leading to his ground-level airbnb, and two up to his gardens. Moody will add color wherever he can to his property at the corner of West 28th Street and Humboldt Avenue South. In addition to the many flights of rainbow steps, people might recognize the house for its large purple rocking chair out front. The chair is his niece’s, Moody says with a grin.  
Many pass by Moody’s home throughout the day, whether they’re on their way to walk around the Lake of the Isles or heading out to Hennepin Avenue. The current construction also brings more eyes to the property as cars are diverted. The corner lot serves as the bus stop for Kenwood Elementary School. Kids like to hang out by the rainbow, Moody said. The spot is also next door to a 55 years old and up housing facility. 
 


 


 


 


“You know, it touches them that it brings beauty and that was the whole point of the sidewalk – beauty,” Moody said. “It was a blank sidewalk and now that the paint is gone you can see how blank a sidewalk really is.”
Moody has invested deeply in his neighborhood, said neighbor Steve Havig. Havig hopes to see his sidewalk project continue. To him, it’s an extension of Moody’s mission to connect people through art. Moody also works on art shows and community events at Grace Trinity Church, where he is deeply involved.
“He is bringing the neighborhood together, and in the time when neighborhood people do not know their neighbors,” Havig said.
The process
 


 


Moody is working with the Minneapolis Arts and Cultural Affairs Department to determine next steps to get the sidewalk painted rainbow again. 
A permit is needed to create public art in the city’s “right of way,” which includes city sidewalks, boulevards and streets, said Public Arts Supervisor Mary Altman. Permits like this are often done through “
paint the pavement projects.
” 
Moody’s sidewalk is rare because he is looking to garner a permit as an individual property owner. Usually projects like this are done through a nonprofit, neighborhood organization or government entity, Altman said. The guidelines require the permit holder to be one of these entities. 
“We don’t normally give permits for public art to individuals, but it’s very common for an individual to get one of those groups to be a permit holder.,” Altman said. “It’s also a good collaboration because there are some other requirements, including liability insurance.” 
 


 


Community engagement is also a requirement for a paint the pavement project. An artist also must be involved and paid.
As to the question of if the segment counts as graffiti, Altman said graffiti is generally considered something that is not allowed by the property owner. In this case the property owner is the city. But Altman still considers this particular case art rather than graffiti. 
“I would say, in my opinion, this is not graffiti. This was unpermitted art. An artist painted it. But whoever called and made the complaint probably didn’t know that,” she said.

For the first time, the USA Gymnastics Championships, the National Congress & Trade Show, Gymfest, Flip Zone and the Olympic Trials for trampoline and gymnastics have combined into nine days of nonstop flipping and fan fun. And it’s all taking place in Minneapolis – or Gymnastics City USA as 
Gov. Tim Walz proclaimed
 at a kick off event Monday. 
Minneapolis has made a name for itself on the national stage hosting what Minnesota Sports and Events President and CEO Wendy Blackshaw calls “ancillary” events. 
“This tends to be our secret sauce,” Blackshaw said at a kickoff event Monday. “The ancillary events we do, I mean, most of our events, there aren’t very many other cities that go to the extent that we do and we do it because we don’t want it to just be the people who are coming. We want the region, statewide – we want everyone to come down and participate.”
 


 


And they are.
From Biron Gymnastics in Houston to K & G Gymnastics in Mankato, gymnastics clubs from around the country are bringing large groups of gymnasts and coaches to spend the week in Minneapolis competing and watching their idols at the Olympic Trials.

“We went to St. Louis three years ago to the Olympic Trials there, but to have it here in Minnesota where you have such a strong showing of gymnasts participating in the trials – I just think it will do wonders to the culture of gymnastics in the community,” said K & G Gymnastics coach, Gabe Essay.
Gymnast Annie Essay also traveled from Mankato to attend this weekend’s trials and the events associated with them.
 


 


“I didn’t really think Minneapolis was ever gonna have anything actually cool like this,” she said.

Over the years, Minneapolis has made a name for itself in hosting large scale events from the men’s and women’s Big 10 basketball tournaments to men’s and women’s basketball NCAA Final Four and of course, the Super Bowl. According to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Minneapolis is the best city in the country to host these kinds of events.
“We do it really well.,” Frey said. “We’ve got the infrastructure set up and we’ve got the know-how and experience to get the job done. That’s why Li Li (Leung) and USAG (USA Gymnastic) are choosing Minneapolis.”
Melvin Tennant, the president and CEO of Meet Minneapolis – which promotes tourism for the city – expects the event to have a big economic impact. 
 


 


“We know that it’s going to be very, very significant.” He also has a hunch there might be some record hotel occupancies.

Prior events, like the 2018 Super Bowl, for example, had around $370 million in economic impacts, the NCAA Men’s Basketball Final Four in 2019 brought around $143 million, and the NCAA Women’s Basketball Final Four in 2022 was just under $35 million, he said. 
Tennant said gymnastics is a well-loved sport in the country with a big fan base.
“I think we can all name famous gymnasts of our particular era,” he said. “(It) ranks as one of the highest-rated Olympic sports. And this is really significant because this is the actual team that’s going to be representing our country in Paris in just a few weeks.” 
 


 


And as Sen. Amy Klobuchar indicated in her remarks, it just makes sense that these particular events would come to Minneapolis of all places. 
“We are a gymnastics state,” Klobuchar said. “We are home to some of the best junior club programs, outstanding college gymnastics and elite Olympic level gymnasts from Gopher alum in Spring Park native, Shane Wiskus, five-time Pan American championship medalist and, of course, Minnesota’s own Suni Lee.”
 


 


Thursday, downtown Minneapolis had lots of foot traffic along Nicollet Mall which has been transformed into Parisian-themed Promenade du Nord for the trials. People walked through the street market, stopping by local vendors to shop and eat while enjoying music, dancing from Minnesota Vikings cheerleaders, and meeting local sports mascots.
“So far it’s going very well,” said Phoebe Lot, who was working the Minnesota Awesome tent at the market event on Nicollet Avenue on Thursday. “Even if people aren’t buying, they’re just coming and looking at stuff and taking pictures. That has as big of an impact too as just buying something.”
 


 


A couple of streets down, the patio of Zelo, an Italian dining spot, was packed full. 
“We’ve got a lot of people excited about the show and they’re having some wine and lighter meals,” said David Meier, a bartender and server at Zelo. 
The next days, he anticipates, will be just as busy. 
“Events are kind of like our bread and butter,” Meier said. “We love things like this.” 
While it hadn’t been too busy over at Kieran’s Irish Pub for the first part of the week, according to Lucky Nguyen, a bartender at the pub across the street from Target Center, he anticipates the rush this weekend.
“We’re all preparing for the battle that’s to come,” Nguyen said. “This pub gets pretty busy depending on what’s going on. We got Timberwolves season, that was super crazy packed, St. Patrick’s Day, super crazy packed … I think we’re expecting just around that much, if not even more. I think what’s going to be different is we have a lot of people from out of town. People travel the world and come from different cities just to watch the Olympic Trials.”

Landing events such as the Olympic Trials is not just good for Minneapolis as a whole, but downtown in particular, said Ward 3 Minneapolis City Council Member Michael Rainville. 
“I look at it through the lens of job creation,” Rainville said. “There’s upwards of 30,000 people in the hospitality industry in Minneapolis. The hotels are full, the restaurants. We have not only the Olympics but pride and it’s just going to be full, it’s going to be exciting and that’s the vitality that’s been lacking in all urban areas in the United States. COVID was terrible, but now we’re back and this proves that.”
This weekend’s festivities will coincide with Twin Cities Pride, meaning downtown will be full of both residents and tourists alike. And in just a few weeks Taste of Minnesota will return downtown with music and food. The combination of these events, according to both Walz and Frey, is good momentum for the city and the state overall.
“What you’re seeing is a comeback story that people throughout the country are going to follow,” Frey said.

Kathy Robbins remembers a time when she longed to read about the LGBTQ+ community in the Twin Cities, only to find mostly negative stories when she opened the pages of her newspaper.
“The mainstream press did not include us unless there was a murder in Loring Park or something,” said Robbins, a librarian at 
Quatrefoil Library
. 
Robbins, who identifies as lesbian and moved to the Twin Cities in 1978, has volunteered at 
Quatrefoil Library
 since the 1990s. The library, founded in 1986, holds collections of LGBTQ+ media — books, movies, newsletters, CDs and newspapers and magazines — that tell stories not found in the mainstream media decades ago. 
 


 


The mainstream press might not have paid much attention to LGBTQ+ life in those days, but others did.
Indeed, as the annual Pride Month celebration nears an end, Robbins remembered the 1990s and early 2000s as a time when the Twin Cities market for LGBTQ+ media was at its peak with publications like Equal Time, Focus Point, GLC Voice, Gaze Magazine, Lavender and others.

Many of those publications — some dating to the 1970s — did not last long, and even the ones that did, like Equal Time, are not around anymore. Lavender, a bi-weekly publication that started in 1995, remains.

Those magazines and newspapers, Robbins recalled, published stories pertaining to the LGBTQ+ community and also served as tools for socialization and community building. 
Referring to Equal Time, she said: “This is the news of the community and people and obituaries and movies and whatever it was. There’s a lot of content in that. Same with Focus Point.”  
 


 


The community-based papers had a symbiotic relationship with gay people and their allies. For example, Kathy’s wife was a real estate agent who would advertise in the papers. It also served as a form of social media, in a way, because people could put information in the classified ads — similar to dating profiles.
Publication challenges
Covering LGBTQ+ communities presented many challenges, too. Sapa Carlson worked on the advertising team at Equal Time and later went on to start Focus Point with someone else.

“It was a really hard time because most gay people were not out and wanted information and news, but many people were afraid to even have somebody see them pick up a newspaper, afraid to go to a gay bar,” Carlson said. “Imagine being a reporter and yet you can’t put anybody’s name in the story that you’re writing about because they’re afraid they’ll get fired or lose their housing.”

Carlson had just lost her job as a camp director after her supervisors found out she was gay when she was hired at Equal Time to work in advertising. 
 


 


“They wanted to grow the newspaper, but they didn’t want mainstream advertising. You couldn’t get a lot of gay ads, because that would be outing people and so you can see how the conflict sets up,” she said. “We wanted to become part of the mainstream so that we didn’t need a gay newspaper. We wanted our stories to be published. We wanted to go anywhere, to do anything, and not to be singled out or prevented from doing things because we were gay.”

While Focus Point and Equal Time would deliver papers through local spaces, like bars and coffee shops, they had subscriber lists and would mail the newspapers to subscribers in plain envelopes with no return address. 
“They were afraid somebody would see that they got a gay newspaper,” she said. “We had people that would help us to deliver the newspaper in bundles. Sort of like the dark of night. We would take these bundles of newspapers and put them in stands. And the biggest distribution place, of course, was the gay bars.” 
But the business model wasn’t sustainable, so it went under, she recalled. “It was kind of a real tragedy for the community,” she said. 
 


 


Carlson then helped to start Focus Point but left after a couple of years due to differences with her business partner. That publication went out of business in 2000.
Stories that made an impact
Equal Time and Focus Point would write about happenings in the community, like softball leagues or people who had left an impact. The publications also contained lots of educational information and resources around advocacy and health — information that these communities weren’t getting in other media. 
Ultimately, Carlson said, the media organizations helped to create change around how people perceived LGBTQ+ communities.

“We were part of that change when the change was happening,” she said. “To some degree, we helped the change to happen just by continuing to exist and getting people more comfortable. And then human rights legislation became more of a reality, and corporations like General Mills and 3M and Allianz started to embrace gay workers.” 
 


 


The day-to-day stories of LGBTQ+ life weren’t being told in other spaces or pages. 
“(The mainstream press) wouldn’t care that there was a court case about lesbian custody, which was a big thing,” said Robbins, the Quatrefoil librarian. “You were married. You had kids. Then you came out as a lesbian. And the dad was going to take the kids because it’s, ‘You’re unfit to be a mother.’ And that was very common, unfortunately. We cared about it. The mainstream press didn’t care.” 
Is there a gap? 
While many of those stories are now included in the mainstream local press, some feel there’s still space in the market for what those shuttered papers once brought to the communities. 
“Now, maybe I could say there’s not a need for that kind of newspaper,” Robbins said.

Others, like Claude Peck — the former managing editor of Q Monthly, a subsection of the Twin Cities Reader, a weekly alternative paper that started in 1994 — feel there are still gaps in coverage of LGBTQ+ communities in the Twin Cities. 
Q Monthly began as 4-6 pages in the Twin Cities Reader and then became a standalone monthly paper in 1995. Peck estimated that Q Monthly had a distribution of roughly 25,000. 
“To this day, I remain very proud of the publication. It had lots of things that I think had been lacking in LGBTQ publications in the Twin Cities,” he said. “We had been pretty well served by things like Equal Time and we had sort of an argumentative paper called GLC Voice. But what I wanted to do with Q Monthly, I wanted longer articles. I wanted really good feature writing. I wanted news. We would do some news, some features, but we also had a lot of attitude.” 
The Twin Cities Reader and City Pages were bought in 1997 by Anne Stern Publishing. Q Monthly then went under the umbrella of City Pages — another Minneapolis alternative weekly paper — and continued until Q Monthly was shut down in 1998.
Claude Peck: “To this day, I remain very proud of [Q Monthly]. It had lots of things that I think had been lacking in LGBTQ publications in the Twin Cities.”

Peck doesn’t think the media today covers these communities in the same way that those publications did. 
“There’s a little bit of absorption of, I would say, gay energy or gay perspectives into the mainstreams,” he said. “But not something that, to me, substitutes for, or replaces, a vibrant and varied number of queer publications like we used to have.”
He added: “I think there’s lip service. I think there’s seasonal stuff that pops up, but I wouldn’t say that I’m seeing kind of in-depth coverage. Is there a reporter at the Star Tribune that covers the GLBT community? No, there just isn’t.”
While other forms of LGBTQ+ media have been on the rise — like the movies and books exhibited at Quatrefoil Library — there’s less coverage of the community. Peck said he’s a fan of one audio show, 
Fresh Fruit
 on KFAI, which has been running since 1978.

After a year of waiting, project planners have answered some of their questions in a 2,800-page document they published on June 14. The document, 
which is required by federal law
, finds building the extension in Minneapolis, Robbinsdale, Crystal, and Brooklyn Park would require:
Closing and realigning around 20 intersections 


Increasing traffic congestion at over nine intersections


Removing over 1,400 parking spaces


Acquiring 48 buildings with 36 of those occupants relocated


Affecting just over 
60 acres of significant ecological areas
 where threatened species thrive


Exposing potentially-contaminated soils at 433 locations


Building over poorly-drained soils and rock susceptible to sinkholes 


Generating “severe” noise and vibration affecting around 200 households
The project team previously finalized an environmental review of the project in 2016. But that review was for an old alignment they abandoned in 2020 because they 
could not negotiate with a railroad company
 to use some of their space. As they finalized realigning the project through north Minneapolis and onto Bottineau Boulevard last September, the project team needed to conduct a supplemental environmental review to determine any new impacts the project would have. 
The document, including its technical appendices, can be reviewed 
online
. Print copies of the main document sans technical appendices are also available at the North Regional, Brooklyn Park and Rockford Road libraries, as well as the Blue Line Extension project office in St. Louis Park. 
 


 


The agencies are accepting comments on the document by email, 
web form
, or 
voicemail
 until Aug. 6. They will also solicit comments 
in person through office hours and two public hearings
. They will then review and plan to incorporate comments into a final version of the document to be released early next year. 
“Comments are an important part of the process, because they provide real-world feedback on the impacts listed in the (Supplemental Draft EIS), they provide an important basis for how we design the mitigations,” said Met Council spokesperson John Schadl. “When the (Supplemental Final EIS) is ultimately published it will include those benefits and mitigations.”
METRO Blue Line Light Rail Transit Extension

Here are six things you need to know about the report and what it says about how the project will affect the Northside and the northwest suburbs. 
Expanding light rail may enhance bike and transit infrastructure 
Met Council and Hennepin County say in the report that building the Blue Line Extension is important because it will reduce pollution and satiate the region’s needs for transit that is as fast as driving as the population grows, ages, diversifies, and changes in ability. This is in spite of the pandemic, which resulted in people working from home more often, as well as ridership being spread out more during the day. 
 


 


Using a ridership prediction model that accounts for pre-pandemic and pandemic-induced ridership patterns, planners believe 
6,400 people
 will start taking transit because of the Blue Line Extension by 2045. They believe this would 
decrease 62,000 vehicle miles traveled per day
, or about 22.6 million vehicle miles traveled annually.  
Planners also say the project would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
around 8,000 metric tons of CO
2
 equivalent
 in 2045, helping achieve local, regional, and state goals in reducing transportation pollution. At 25%, transportation emissions is the
 No. 1 source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state
, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. 
Brooklyn Center resident Kamal Ouhmed says he is looking forward to the light rail project because he would no longer have to rely on expensive ride hail services to get around. “It’s gonna be great, it’s better than using transportation cars like Uber and Lyft because it’s expensive. It costs $35 to go to the airport using Uber and Lyft,” Ouhmed said while out on a walk on Bass Lake Road in Crystal on a hot Sunday. 
The project would also create bikeways similar to that on Hennepin Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, on 7th Street and Oak Lake Avenue, as well as two-way bikeways on 10th and 21st avenues in Minneapolis. 
 


 


Expanded light rail may reduce parking and pedestrian access while increasing traffic
The report also says the light rail project would require planners to remove parking and traffic lanes, as well as close off intersections to people driving, biking, and walking. This has West Broadway businesses and residents concerned about the loss of parking, loading, and business access, as well as northwest metro residents concerned about traffic congestion. 
The report shows seven intersections would 
“exceed capacity”
 during the afternoon rush hour if the project were built, mostly in Minneapolis and Brooklyn Park. Two intersections in Brooklyn Park, at 85th and 93rd avenues, would “exceed capacity” regardless of whether the project would be built (the project would also widen West Broadway). Planners predict intersections in Robbinsdale and Crystal would remain “under capacity,” though two intersections in Crystal — Bass Lake Road and Wilshire Boulevard — 
would be “at capacity”
 if the agency opted not to elevate Bottineau Boulevard over Bass Lake Road.

St. Paul City Council disagreement reaches boiling point behind closed doors
 






 


Met Council and Hennepin County staff determined capacity by using a metric called Level of Service, which measures how long people driving private automobiles would have to wait before being able to cross an intersection. Intersections that “exceed capacity” means each driver would have to wait more than 50 seconds to cross an 
unsignalized intersection
, or more than 80 seconds to cross a signalized intersection. The 
report
 and its 
technical appendices
, however, does not specify in seconds how long drivers would actually have to wait in 2045 compared to today.
Ann Tranvik, a Robbinsdale resident who organizes with the group Stop Light Rail on 81, remains concerned about traffic and questions whether people will actually stop driving and start taking the light rail when it is built. The group wants Hennepin County and the Met Council to either study bus rapid transit or to run it on the BNSF railroad corridor, and plan to host a rally at the lower level of the Wicked Wort Brewery in Robbinsdale at 7 p.m. Wednesday. 
 


 


“Everybody assumes that will reduce car traffic. Not as many people go down to Minneapolis to work anymore. So that group of people isn’t moving in their vehicles to go to work. They’re crossing back and forth, going east and west, to random places that have nothing to do with light rail, because you can’t move around in this really widely developed city,” Tranvik said. 
Meanwhile, in north Minneapolis, residents and business owners are concerned about the loss of parking and loading spaces. Planners would remove up to 
1,461 spaces
 along the project corridor, with 828 of those spaces coming from Minneapolis. 
KB Brown, a Northside resident who owns Wolfpack Promotionals on West Broadway, 
previously told MinnPost
 that he needs parking in front of his shop so people can make deliveries. With plans to reduce traffic lanes to one in each direction, Brown is concerned about delivery vehicles blocking traffic. “When I have deliveries and stuff, where are they gonna stop at? Because if they stop in front of my shop to deliver, they’re stopping all traffic,” Brown said.
Project planners plan to build around 
1,500 parking spaces spread across four park-and-ride facilities
 in Robbinsdale, Crystal, and Brooklyn Park. In Minneapolis, they plan to refine the project design around Penn and West Broadway to preserve as much parking as possible, as well as conduct studies on how the parking is being used to determine where they should keep parking. The report also says the city of Minneapolis has a plan to attain 60% of citywide travel by modes other than car by 2030. 
 


 


They also plan to close around 20 intersections to people driving, biking, and walking. The report cites a number of reasons for doing so, such as to create space for light rail tracks and stations, as well as to “reduce traffic conflicts.” The closures include around 50 marked and unmarked pedestrian crossings in Minneapolis and Brooklyn Park, mostly along Washington, 21st, and West Broadway avenues, 
according to rollplots that were released in March
. 
Dean Rose, the owner of the Broadway Liquor Outlet at West Broadway and Penn, is worried the closures would make it harder to revitalize West Broadway and make it safe for people to enjoy themselves. “This bifurcation that they will create, and the monstrosity of infrastructure that they’re going to put in, is going to destroy that feel, just like it did on University Avenue,” Rose said in an interview. 
The Jordan Area Community Council and the West Broadway Business Coalition sent a letter to project planners last year, asking them to evaluate running light rail above-ground or underground to minimize impacts to people driving, walking, and biking. Neither of these alternatives, along with bus rapid transit alternatives, appeared to be evaluated in the report. The community council also asked the agency to clarify how the light rail project is compatible with the 2007 
West Broadway Alive plan
, which called for a streetcar line.   
The report is also unsure of 
how the project will affect crashes
. They plan to provide an analysis in the final report.
Some property will be taken and people displaced
Hennepin County and the Met Council anticipate purchasing 
37 properties
, displacing occupants from 36 of them. They also plan to partially take an additional 303 properties. In Minneapolis, 34 buildings would be taken, with 27 occupants needing relocation. 
Federal law requires the agencies displacing people provide relocation assistance, which includes advisory services, reimbursements for moving and resettlement expenses, and a minimum of 90 days written notice to vacate. The state Legislature also appropriated 
$10 million for anti-displacement
 and created a group to dole out that money. 
As planners deliberate whether or not to move forward with the project, Davrashawn Johnson is frustrated. Johnson is working with her father, Thomas Johnson III, 
the son of the first Black doctor in Minnesota
, in renovating a two-story building home to an invite-only bottle club called the Old Timers Club, formerly the All-American Negro Club, at West Broadway just north of 26th Avenue. 
After having the ceilings, walls, and bathrooms removed, she paused the renovation as soon as she heard about the proposals earlier this year. Planners are considering demolishing the building, and she is having trouble securing loans to finish the project. “Lenders right here in the city do not want to touch it,” said Johnson in an interview. 
Lenders have previously withdrawn funding from Black developers along the corridor because
 of this project. 
 


 


But planners argue in the impact report that the project would result in 
increased earnings and tax revenue
. They believe the project would connect people to jobs, including jobs to design, build, and operate the extension. The spending money the workers earn, the report says, would create demand for more jobs. It may also spur development and increase property values, which planners caution could increase property taxes and potentially displace current residents and business owners. 
Building the project could affect historic resources, aggravate polluted sites
The report also identified 433 sites along the corridor that may be polluted, including 152 that have “high potential for contamination,” which are defined by the Minnesota Department of Transportation as superfund sites, dump sites, leak sites, dry cleaners, gas stations, as well as sites that may have used chemicals such as darkrooms, plating facilities, dental practices, and drug labs. Disturbing those soils during construction could threaten human health. 
Planners believe such high-risk sites include the Dragon Star Supermarket and the proposed operations and maintenance facility site 
in Brooklyn Park
, the 
Crystal Airport
, 
Robbinsdale
 Town Center, the Redwell apartments in North Loop, as well as the northside Cub, Shiloh Temple International Ministries, and the Capri Theater, all in 
north Minneapolis
. They plan to collect and analyze soils and report their findings, along with associated mitigation measures, in the final supplemental environmental document. 
Finally, environmental documents identified as many as 31 neighborhoods and buildings considered historic or potentially historic by federal law that could be affected by light rail stations and noise. They include the Jordan neighborhood, the West Broadway residential district in Robbinsdale, the Grand Rounds bike trail network, as well as the North Community YMCA, which they believe helped redevelop the West Broadway corridor in the 1970s as the Northside reeled from economic disinvestment and racial unrest. 
A technical memo suggests impacts to historic landmarks could be mitigated with education, noise monitoring efforts during construction, as well as construction mitigation efforts.
Noise and vibration impacts will be different for Minneapolis, suburbs 
The light rail extension project could make the suburbs quieter and Minneapolis a lot noisier. The wheels of the trains, which will comprise three light rail cars, will create noise and vibration as they roll on the tracks. The noise can be louder depending on how the track is laid. Planners expect trains to generate additional noise, such as warning bells, as they cross an intersection or enter and exit a station. Depending on where one lives, it could make their surrounding environment louder. 
The report finds 173 households, all in Minneapolis, will be “severely” affected by increased noise generated from trains running on the Blue Line Extension. 
The federal definition of “severe” noise impacts
 ranges from 55 decibels in an area intended for quiet, such as a place where people sleep, to 80 decibels in places such as schools, libraries, theaters, and churches. Existing noise levels vary, from 
54 to 70 dB
. 
About two-thirds of those households 
are located in the North Loop neighborhood
, and 31 households are located along 21st Avenue in north Minneapolis. In those zones, people are living very close to trains as they travel as fast as 40 miles per hour. Other areas where the train is operating at slower speeds or are farther away from the tracks will experience a smaller increase — and in some cases, a decrease — in sound. 
Meanwhile, about 28 households in north Minneapolis will be “severely” affected by vibration. A federal definition of “severe” vibrations is if 
72 vibration-decibels occur more than 70 times per day from the same source near a place where people sleep
. 
The report says they can 
reduce noise
 from light rail trains by installing dampers on the wheels and tracks, or installing noise absorbers under the light rail trains. The agency also currently covers the wheels on its existing light rail trains. They can also build walls and berms — just not in Minneapolis — or provide sound insulation for surrounding buildings. As for vibration, they are considering placing a 
concrete-mounted rubber layer 
under ballast or concrete on 10th and 21st avenues. 
The Blue Line Extension would be built over an area where sinkholes could form and threatened species thrive
Planners find the project would be built in areas where less than 50 feet of glacial sand, gravel, or sandy soils (called loam) separate the surface from limestone. These areas, which include downtown and parts of north Minneapolis, including parts of the 
West Broadway
 corridor, are considered active 
karst
 areas. The karst area may have underground springs, as well as caverns and sinkholes which are formed 
over millions of years by erosion
. 
But because project staff don’t know where the karst features are, save for two of them in downtown Minneapolis, they believe any discoveries of such features during construction could require them to change how the light rail project is designed, built, and operated. For example, one need not look far to the Southwest light rail project, where engineers had to orchestrate a $500-million, three-year change in building 
the Kenilworth tunnel
 after they found boulders while trying to drive steel sheets into the ground to support tunnel wall construction. 
Planners are also concerned with groundwater contamination while building over an active karst area. To reduce the risk of groundwater contamination, they plan to pump water out while working in trenches around areas of high groundwater, as well as on steep slopes or “other topographic extremes.” 
The report also finds the location of their proposed operations and maintenance facility would require building through 
poorly-drained soils
, as well as destroy forest and 
prairie
 habitats for threatened species such as the monarch butterfly and the 
Northern long-eared bat
. The tracks themselves could also trap the state-threatened Blanding’s turtle.
The project team plans to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service to minimize impacts to those species as much as possible. And, to account for poor soils, engineers plan to dig more than they need to, replacing some of the fill with compacted or lightweight fill.
Editor’s note: This story has been updated with a new deadline for comments and more context from the Metropolitan Council on how public comments will be used.

The city of Minneapolis has in its files planning documents dating back to 1937 indicating that it anticipated a significant portion of north Minneapolis to be dedicated to “slums” for Black and Jewish people. 
In the months ahead, several of those blocks will instead be covered by a modern modular housing manufacturing plant. Amid a crowd of several dozen lively attendees late Tuesday morning were multiple state and Minneapolis leaders including Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Attorney General Keith Ellison and, of course, the man of the hour, former NBA star Devean George. 
His company, George Modular Solutions, broke ground on the redevelopment of an 83,000-square-foot manufacturing facility on Washington Avenue near 14th Street that will build modular residential housing and commercial structures while bringing sustainable, living-wage employment to north Minneapolis. 
 


 


It’s the latest step in his efforts to boost the neighborhood where he grew up. 
“It’s because this community has, in the past and still, supports me and has made me who I am,” George said. “This community has protected me, has taught me, has nurtured me, has babysat me, has given me every opportunity. And they still support me. And so, I’m humbled by that. Now, my duty is to bring these resources and opportunities to our community.”

Project details
 
The project’s estimated cost of about $30 million will cover expansion, site improvements, the addition of machinery and equipment and property acquisition costs, according to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. It’s expected to create more than 300 jobs. 
Modular construction has been gaining popularity. The model stacks prefabricated pieces that are constructed offsite and then brought to the development site for construction.

George Group North paid $11.8 million for the former printing facility as part of a deal that closed in March. George had previously looked at another site in the North Loop, but that property was not zoned for manufacturing. 
“This is a great day for Minnesota,” exclaimed Walz, one of several speakers at the groundbreaking.

In addition to the new jobs, he predicted the project would help create generational wealth for families in north Minneapolis. 
“This is the solution, it’s high-tech manufacturing,” Walz said. “That solves a lot of problems. It solves the housing crisis. It solves generational wealth issues. At the base of it, it creates those sustained jobs for middle-class families. That’s what everybody is looking at.” 
 


 


Much done, much to do
The project represents the next step in George’s efforts to use his resources to help his old neighborhood build housing and provide opportunities for residents. 
 


 


Previously, in Minneapolis, George Group North has been involved in Penn Avenue Union, a five-story mixed-use development on the northwest corner of Penn Avenue and Golden Valley Road with 64 units and about 20,000 square feet of community service space and Commons at Penn, a 45-unit, mixed-use apartment building across the street. Both were on city-owned land. 
George believes successful communities begin with stable housing. He has also been involved in redeveloping existing homes in major metropolitan markets and owns rental properties with the goal of providing quality, affordable rental and luxury, high-end facilities to meet the needs of all potential customers. 
He has not done any modular construction on his existing projects but became interested in the model because he often felt his and other housing projects took too long to develop, according to a company spokesperson. The model reduces costs and increases the speed at which homes are delivered to the market.

George thanked many, including his parents, who worked multiple jobs in between his basketball games while he was growing up to ensure he would have opportunities to succeed. He promised to work as hard in rebuilding north Minneapolis as he did in becoming the first and only Division III basketball player taken in the first round of the NBA draft in 1999. 
“My grit came from my community,” he said. “My toughness came from my mom and dad. My work ethic came from my mom and dad. They attended every basketball game. After the game, most parents went to sleep. Mine went to work.” 
He thanked long-time lawyers and banking partner, Sunrise Banks, which provided $8 million of New Markets Tax Credit and millions more in financing for the project. He also thanked the city of Minneapolis, which contributed a $2 million loan for the project. The state contributed $3 million, as well. 
Now he wants to get to work helping the people who supported and helped him on the way up.
 


 


“Things are good for me on my side,” he said. “I just can’t sleep at night without doing everything I can to put my resources back into the community.”

Deshaun Hill Jr. was supposed to have graduated from high school earlier this month. 
And just weeks before he was meant to receive his diploma with the rest of his Minneapolis North High School classmates the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the conviction of the man who killed the 15-year-old quarterback.
Despite a vow from Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty to appeal the ruling to the Minnesota Supreme Court and retry the case depending on the outcome of the appeal, the reversal has reopened wounds felt by a community still mourning the loss of the promising teenager. 
 


 


“(The decision) reinforces the devaluing of Black life in Minnesota and our feelings that it’s very difficult to obtain justice,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney, activist and north Minneapolis resident. “It feels like a slap in the face to a community that has already dealt with so much pain and trauma that we have yet to get to heal from.”
The Court of Appeals late last month ruled the state failed to prove statements provided by Cody Fohrenkam, who was convicted of Hill’s murder and sentenced last year to more than 38 years in prison, were legally obtained.

Shortly after the shooting, Minneapolis Police investigators learned that Fohrenkam was in custody in Carlton County on unrelated charges and traveled there to interrogate him, but did so after he was due to be released. In his appeal, Fohrenkam argued the investigators violated his constitutional rights by interrogating him after a judge had ordered his release, and the unlawfully obtained statements could have influenced the jury’s decision, prompting the appellate court to reverse the conviction.

“It’s the state’s job to show that (Fohrenkam) should have been detained and they didn’t introduce any evidence of that, and the trial judge didn’t require evidence of that,” said Rachel Moran, University of St. Thomas School of Law professor and founder of the school’s Criminal and Juvenile Defense Clinic. “That had huge ramifications for Deshaun Hill’s family and this community … but it all boils down to the judge’s and the prosecutor’s error in not introducing evidence to show that (Forrenkam’s) confession was properly obtained.”
 


 


In the days following the court’s decision, Moriarty released a video vowing to appeal the reversal of the conviction to the Minnesota Supreme Court in an effort to ensure the conviction stands and Fohrenkam serves out the rest of his sentence. If the Supreme Court decides not to take up the case or agrees with the ruling of the appellate court, Moriarty said her office will retry the case. If the Supreme Court disagrees with the Court of Appeals’ reversal, the conviction will be officially reinstated and Fohrenkam will serve out the rest of his sentence. 
 


 


Fohrenkam remains in custody as the process plays out, but should the case be retried his attorneys will have the right to ask for another bail hearing in an effort to have him released. But Moriarty’s office will again ask for a high bail amount to keep him in custody “because we believe he is a danger to the community (and) we have every reason to expect the courts will set high bail,” she said. 
“D Hill was an inspiration to many – to many of you and to many in the community,” Moriarty said in the video statement. “I want to assure you as Hennepin County Attorney, we will do the very best we can to make sure that the person who murdered him is held accountable.”
Hill, the starting quarterback of the high school’s football team, was a renowned figure among his classmates and the north Minneapolis community at large. A docuseries aired on Showtime, “Boys in Blue” was meant to showcase the football team and the police officers who coached them in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, but Hill’s killing toward the end of filming gave the series a sense of sadness along with the pride felt by the community around the team.
 


 


Moran said while it’s not surprising Moriarty decided to appeal the ruling instead of immediately moving to retry the case, another trial seems like the inevitable outcome.
“I think they don’t want to have to retry the case because it’s obviously time and effort consuming, and I think they’re also trying to make a show of support for Hill’s family by saying they disagree with the ruling,” Moran said. “But I think it would actually be a little bit unlikely for the Supreme Court to take this case, so ultimately, it might just be a step they’re taking but it ends up that they need to retry the case anyway.”
Levy Armstrong said she trusts Moriarty to do what she can to pursue justice for Hill and his family, and urged community members to have patience as this process unfolds.
“It is important for us to have patience while the case is working its way through the judicial system, and to also have faith that at the end of the day that justice will prevail in this situation, one way or the other,” she said. “That is a lot to ask for (from) our community, which has already been kicked so many times, but I think that it’s necessary at this moment for us to take that approach.”

Editor’s note: This story has been updated with comments from the Minnesota Department of Transportation.
Our Streets hosted a Rethinking I-94 rally last week in Minneapolis that brought together a coalition of community members, activists, and public officials advocating for transformative changes to the I-94 corridor. 
At the event, Yasmin Hirsi, Advocacy Coordinator at Our Streets, emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach that prioritizes community well-being and equitable infrastructure. Hirsi spoke of negative impacts of I-94 has on public health, neighborhood economies, and social cohesion. She also read a statement from Minneapolis City Council member Robin Wonsley supporting the 
Twin Cities Boulevard project
, which calls for a shift from car-centric infrastructure to investments in public transit, pedestrian, and cycling-friendly alternatives. 
 


 


“I-94 runs through Ward 2, and my residents are some of those who bear the disproportionate impacts of the highway,” Hirsi read from the Council Member Wonsley’s statement. “Our public health, our neighborhood economies, and our social fabric are harmed every single day by the highway. That’s why I consistently supported the Twin Cities Boulevard and the vision for a multimodal corridor that invests in healthy, safe, equitable, and thriving communities.”
A spokesperson with MnDOT told MinnPost via email that two of the 
proposed alternatives
 shared in 2023 included an at-grade roadway. “This alternative most resembles the so-called Twin Cities Boulevard concept promoted by Our Streets,” said MnDOT spokesperson Ricardo Lopez.

The rally underscored the historical injustices associated with highway construction, particularly the 
displacement of low-income and minority communities
. Hirsi drew parallels to the Civil Rights era, stressing that highway projects have long reinforced racial segregation and economic inequality by destroying neighborhoods and displacing families, particularly in Black and immigrant communities.
“True progress isn’t measured solely by the number of lanes or the speed of traffic but by the health, prosperity, and equity of our communities,” Hirsi stated.

Speakers at the rally also voiced their concerns about the current plans for the I-94 corridor. Nathan Kroschel from the 
I-94 Rail Coalition
 advocated for including a regional rail system in the project, emphasizing the unique opportunity to create a grade-separated transit corridor connecting the Twin Cities and beyond.

Ahead of last week’s rally, 
Streets.mn published a piece
 from Seth Bose advocating for the building of a rail system connecting the downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul. “MnDOT issued a Rethinking I-94 survey on the presented projects, with an optional write-in response. The number one write-in suggestion was rail, with a total of 359 responders out of roughly 3,500,” Bose wrote.
Community member Ted Ryan spoke of the inefficiencies and dangers of the current highway system, urging MnDOT to consider rail and bus rapid transit in the I-94 corridor. He argued I-94, as it exists today, is not the most efficient use of space in that area and that expanded rail and bus transit would better serve the community. 
 


 


“There are so many other opportunities for public transportation because we know that I-94 is not an efficient form of transportation. It’s an incredibly expensive form of transportation, it’s an incredibly dangerous form of transportation, and it doesn’t serve our people in the metro area well,” said Ryan.
 


 


Related | A better future for the 10-year-old Green Line should include signal priority, business investment
Hirsi also expressed concerns about MnDOT’s current investments. “We did learn a few days ago that the current draft for the 
State Transportation Improvement Plan
 includes an $80 million investment being planned to go towards rehabilitating bridges along the I-94 corridor,” she mentioned. “This $80 million investment towards the highway before any decision has been made about its future is really concerning. We don’t want this to be the reason they justify keeping this highway.”
Lopez said there is not yet a cost estimate for any of the proposed ideas nor has funding been identified for construction while they work through evaluating alternative plans. “A preferred alternative will be identified later in the environmental review process,” Lopez wrote.
The rally concluded with a call to action for MnDOT to listen to the communities most impacted by the project. Hirsi urged for proactive anti-displacement policies and genuine community engagement in the decision-making process. Ryan echoed this sentiment, stressing the opportunity for a transformative change. 
“The 
Reconnect Rondo
, the Twin Cities Boulevard, the potential for rail or bus— there is a ton of space available for us to give it back to the community,” Ryan said. “This could be the beginning of reparations for many of those communities. We should be demanding more, and this is an opportunity to do so.”
 


 


Lopez said public feedback through comment has been “incorporated into the 
Purpose and Need document
, and helped shape the 
Livability Framework
.” 
“We appreciate the deep community interest and involvement as we work to plan the future of this vital corridor,” Lopez said in a statement to MinnPost. “MnDOT is considering a 
wide range of alternatives
 for the future of this corridor that were developed in partnership with federal, state and local governments, as well as countless technical experts and feedback from the community. In contrast to the original creation of Highway 94, MnDOT is committed to continuing with our community-based approach focused on reconnecting neighborhoods and ensuring community members have a meaningful voice in transportation decisions that affect their lives. We look forward to ongoing engagement from all members of the community as we continue planning for our future project.”

Numerous Juneteenth celebrations were held across the state over the weekend with more to come throughout the week and into the coming weekend. 
This is the second year Juneteenth has been recognized as a state holiday and the fourth year since it was recognized federally. So, for some, the holiday is relatively new. 
It’s particularly important as Juneteenth celebrations grow and more people celebrate, to “remember the why,” said Shemeka Bogan with Strong Roots Foundation, a group that helped sponsor the Northside Juneteenth Celebration. 
 


 


“This is really a learning experience for a lot of people,” Bogan said. 
Juneteenth marks the day more than 250,000 Black people were freed in the state of Texas by executive decree. Though the Emancipation Proclamation was made effective in 1863, this mass freedom was not won until June 19, 1865, when Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas.
“We don’t look at it as just like, ‘OK, it’s just a Black holiday, only Black people can celebrate it,’” Bogan said. “We want white people to celebrate it. We want our Latino brothers and sisters to celebrate it. We want everybody to celebrate with us and understand why it’s an important holiday for us.”

The past weekend’s Northside Juneteenth Celebration started with a free movie screening at the Capri Theater Friday night. On Saturday, a family festival was held on the Lyndale block of West Broadway Avenue and an ice cream social at North Commons Pool Sunday. The goal of the week is to celebrate community, culture and creativity in the Black community, Bogan said. 
 


 


“You have youth groups that are able to come out and showcase their talents and understand why they’re doing that,” she said. “We have art projects that are reflective of different cultures. We have storytelling where our elders are coming in and just telling the history and the stories behind Juneteenth. You forget how far they have come over the years and the different things that they’ve seen. It’s one thing to read something from a history book, but it’s another thing to hear it directly from someone else who is a trusted community member.”

In its second year as a state holiday, Bogan said she feels like Juneteenth celebrations have tripled in the state with many Minnesota cities launching their own Juneteenth celebrations.
 


 


“It’s not just in Minneapolis,” Bogan said. “It’s just been really awesome to see different communities express themselves. It’s really nice to have so many events that are welcoming of all cultures in celebration of Black culture.”  
How Juneteenth became recognized as a national holiday
In 2021, the bill to make Juneteenth a national holiday led by Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., was signed into law by President Joe Biden. During the Saturday Northside Juneteenth Family Festival, Smith told the story about how this law came to be. 
 


 


It started with Opal Lee, a woman born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1928. When Lee was 12 years old, her house was burned down by white rioters who were trying to drive her and her family out of town, Smith said. 
“But she didn’t give up. She was resilient. She became a teacher and when she retired, she became an organizer and an activist,” Smith said.

Lee became one of the strongest advocates for Juneteenth to become a federal holiday and she delivered millions of petitions to Washington, D.C. That’s when Smith met Lee. 
“She came to me and she talked to me about the importance of this and she said, ‘Tina, what are you going to do to make sure that Juneteenth becomes a holiday that we all can celebrate together?’ Miss Lee is not easy to say no to. She’s a feisty grandmother. I believe there are a few feisty grandmothers in this crowd today,” Smith said to the crowd at the event with her words met by nods of agreement. 
 


 


When Kamala Harris became Vice President of the United States, she brought the bill to Smith who said she helped carry it over the finish line. 
“It was one of the most meaningful things that I’ve had a chance to be a part of,” Smith said. “This story is about the story of power and activism and people working and never giving up. And that is also the story of the north side of Minneapolis.”

The massive $350 million 
Upper Harbor Redevelopment
 along the Mississippi River in north Minneapolis’ McKinley neighborhood is officially primed for construction – a project officials say has been 20-years in the making. 
Local and state officials, along with some community members and business owners, gathered at the 53-acre site Saturday morning to celebrate the completion of the project’s first phase. 
It’s not every day a ribbon-cutting and groundbreaking are held back-to-back, but that’s what happened this past Saturday morning. The ribbon-cutting marked the completed construction of the new West River Road and the reconstruction of 33rd Avenue North and Dowling Avenue. The groundbreaking marked what will come next, which includes the development of market rate and affordable housing, a 19-acre park, and a health and wellness hub, then later the construction of an amphitheater.  
 


 


The Upper Harbor Terminal was once the terminus for major barges and ships traveling along the Mississippi River, Mayor Jacob Frey said. 
“This is the ongoing evolution of our city. What once was and was a very useful port or terminus is now going to be an extraordinary park,” he said. “This is adding green space at the finest level and connecting the North Side to the riverfront.”

The plan for the development was adjusted and changed over many years, the mayor noted. It includes many collaborations including partnerships with elected officials, city departments, the park board and community members. This includes the creation of a 15-member Upper Harbor Redevelopment Planning Committee.

Major private players in the redevelopment include United Properties, which Minneapolis city officials chose as the project’s developer. United Properties then partnered with former NBA player and real estate developer Devean George for the housing portion of the plan, which includes 500 units of mixed-use housing. For the future amphitheater and performing arts venue, First Avenue was chosen as the lead. First Avenue has also sought further partnership, 
announcing last year that the Minnesota Orchestra and the African American Community Development Corporation have signed on as “strategic partners.”
 Recently United Properties announced the 
health and wellness hub will be run by InnerCity Tennis.
 


 


“It’s the kind of deal where, once it’s done, everyone will pretend like they were for it from the very beginning,” Frey said. 
Twenty years ago, the first-ever redevelopment plan was drafted for the site of the current Upper Harbor Redevelopment. It is part of the 
Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Above the Falls Regional Park Master Plan
, which started in the 1990, Eric Hanson, director of community planning and economic development, said Saturday. 
“It has been a joy to work on this process with all the ups and downs,” Hanson said. “Community development is not a linear process, and it is not one where everybody comes to the meeting in agreement, so this shows the North Side’s tenacity.” 
Also in attendance were state Sen. Bobby Joe Champion and state House Rep. Fue Lee, both DFL-Minneapolis. Lee chairs the House Capital Investment Committee. The legislators were key to securing $15 million for the infrastructure in the park and $12.5 million for the community Performing Arts Center. 
 


 


The development is a great example of viewing challenges as an opportunity, Champion said Saturday.

“It is so true when the mayor says that at the end of this project, everyone’s gonna say, ‘You know, I was always for that project. You know, I’m glad we got it done,’” he said. 
Chair Lee talked about being the father of a 12-year-old and a 2-year-old.
 


 


“I’m just really excited to see this project go forward for them,” he said. 
 


 


Some north Minneapolis community members felt left out of the celebration of the development, however. 
Al Flowers, a local community activist and host of 89.9 KMOJ radio show  “Community Value Conversations,” said he didn’t know about the ribbon-cutting and groundbreaking until after all was said and done. If the development is for north Minneapolis residents, he said he should have known about it before it happened. 
“It ain’t us out there cutting the ribbon,” he said.

Flowers attended more than a dozen of the very early meetings about the redevelopment, but he says now there needs to be further transparency about what impact it could have on neighboring residents. Many fear gentrification and higher housing costs, he noted, adding that he questions if the development is predominantly for north Minneapolis residents or for outside Minnesotans and developers. 
 


 


“The developer gets money. The little people get nothing,” he said. 
Flowers is not the only one questioning who will ultimately benefit from the project. Justice Jones, associate project manager for north Minneapolis-based nonprofit Community Members for Environmental Justice, said she also attended early meetings and questioned choices made around the redevelopment. 
Ultimately, Jones hopes the housing built along the river will actually be affordable, “not just the buzzword version of affordable,” she said. She also hopes the music venue will be accessible to Northside residents. 
“In my opinion, they’ve made it pretty abundantly clear that this isn’t for the people who live in that space and that it’s more geared toward bringing people from outside of North in,” she said. 
While Jones remains wary of many aspects of the redevelopment, she said she is excited for the park space. She said she wants further transparency around the development as construction continues. 
Longtime North resident Bill English is a member of the Upper Harbor Redevelopment Planning Committee. The committee has been involved in many years of planning, including people, “some of whom are not so fond of the project, others very supportive of it,” he said. 
But English said this was one of the first times the city implemented a community-led committee for a project of this scale. The ownership of the land development is another unique aspect of the project. The developer cannot own the land. They can only lease it, English said. 
“The land will always belong to the community,” he said. “We can avoid gentrification, which is what the Upper Harbor development wants to do, to minimize gentrification. It was part of the goal that we established as a planning committee.”

Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS), like with many districts across the state and country, is facing down a fiscal cliff as federal COVID-19 relief dollars expire come fall. 
This year, MPS is facing a nearly $110 million deficit. As officials have tried to balance the books for the coming budget, 
one of the most controversial proposed cuts was the district’s fifth grade band program. 
In the district’s final 2024-2025 budget, which was passed by the MPS School Board at its Tuesday regular business meeting, band was saved. Other changes made after community feedback included the retention of principals at three district elementary schools and continued funding for central office support for Hmong and Somali heritage language pathway programs. The budget also includes investments in student supports like English learning and interventions, keeping libraries open, and student safety initiatives. It also takes into account feedback about the need for better compensation for staff.
 


 


“This budget provides competitive compensation packages for educators and those staff leading and supporting our schools and district,” said MPS Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams.

The budget adopted Tuesday reflected “countless hours of difficult decisions,” Sayles-Adams said. These decisions included many reductions and cuts, with the largest reduction of more than 10% being applied to Roosevelt High School and Patrick Henry High School (to be named Camden beginning July 1). Most reductions will be applied to central office departments. The budget also assumes 4.75% of district positions will go unfilled in the coming year.

Sayles-Adams started her position as superintendent in February, only a month before budget discussions around the district’s massive deficit began. Three major factors are driving the deficit, according to the superintendent. The first is the expiration of federal COVID-19 relief dollars called Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds. All ESSER funds are to be allocated by the end of September this year, with any non-allocated dollars forfeited after that date. Also contributing to the deficit are rising operations costs and declining student enrollment. 
“These factors made this the most challenging budget development process in recent memory,” Sayles-Adams said Tuesday. “Without a doubt, many great programs and positions we could not afford to continue had to be scaled back.” 
 


 


 


 


This year’s budget is only possible because it uses a “significant amount” of the district’s fund balance, Sayles-Adams said. The district cannot continue to count on its fund balance to sustain its budget at risk of depleting it before evening out its expenses. During the meeting Sayles-Adams referred to the balance as a “savings account” to emphasize this point.
While the school cannot continue to pull funds from its fund balance, there are some additional revenue streams that will help bolster the upcoming budget. MPS plans to ask voters to pass a technology tax this fall, which would levy an estimated $20 million per year. The district will also continue advocacy for more funding from both the state and federal government. 
Some provisions from the state are already in place to help support schools in the face of the end to federal relief dollars. In 2023, lawmakers agreed to raise funding to about $196 million a year for the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 school years. The district will also receive funds from the 
Minnesota Read Act,
 which was passed by the state legislature and signed by Gov. Tim Walz last year. This will not cover all expenses, Sayles-Adams noted. 
MPS is constructed financially to serve about 40,000 students, 
according to a report by the Office of the City Auditor
. However, only about 29,000 students are currently enrolled in the district with the district projecting enrollment to decline to just more than 23,000 students by the 2027-2028 school year. 
In an interview with MPR from earlier this year
, Sayles-Adams attributed lowered enrollment to open enrollment, declining birth rate and a reduction of student enrollment since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 


 


Parents expressed concern about increased class size and other aspects of the budget during the meeting’s public comment. Greg Thompson, a parent of an MPS student, said increased class sizes force parents to consider moving their students to other schools. 
“I know to some extent choices are limited, but please don’t put us in a position to choose between our community and our kids. I’ll choose my kid,” Thompson said.

This story was originally published by 
Twin Cities Business

For 
St. Paul Downtown Alliance
 president Joe Spencer, 
TKDA
’s plans to leave Minnesota’s capital city for the suburbs are heartbreaking, but not entirely surprising. In his view, it only reinforces the need to ramp up commercial-to-residential conversions in St. Paul’s central business district.
Early last month, the engineering and architecture firm announced that it will relocate from its longtime home in downtown St. Paul to a new 87,000-square-foot office in Bloomington in early 2025.
“We’ve known there’s this kind of shakeup coming in commercial real estate here for a while,” Spencer said. “That’s one of the reasons why we are getting ahead of things with our Downtown Investment Strategy,” 
which was released in March
.
 


 


One of the strategy’s three main goals: implementing incentives to encourage commercial-to-residential conversions.
“Drawing upon lessons from other cities in the U.S. and abroad, Saint Paul should create an incentives program that will encourage the conversion of surplus office space (especially in pre-war Class B and C buildings with relatively small floorplates) into much needed residential housing,” the alliance’s report read.

The investment strategy’s other goals are to create more pedestrian-friendly streets and advance redevelopment opportunities.
The overarching goal is to develop an area that appeals to more than just offices and improves the overall downtown experience, Spencer said. By design, the central business district is an area that’s historically been dedicated to office buildings only occupied during business hours.
 


 


“Instead, if we look to have a place where you have a diversity of users around visitors, workers, and residents, then we know we get the kind of traffic we want for a more vibrant downtown,” Spencer said.
Across the river in downtown Minneapolis, a similar dynamic is playing out. Cellphone data analyzed by the University of Toronto School of Cities showed that 
night life and entertainment options are fueling a recovery in downtown Minneapolis
, not nine-to-five office shifts.
 


 


Meanwhile, in the first quarter of 2024, St. Paul’s central business district had an overall vacancy rate of 12.3%, according to the latest data by commercial real estate firm 
Colliers
. That is notably lower than it is in downtown Minneapolis, which had a vacancy rate of 21% over the same time period. But Rob Davis, VP of Colliers International, said this vacancy rate is not “particularly out of order” for St. Paul. He described the area as a “stasis” that is prone to occasional “big swings and big moves.”
Spencer said the Downtown Alliance is looking to convert about 1.5 million square feet from commercial to residential to balance out downtown St. Paul. He said this is doable and already ongoing.
 


 


“We are calling on the public sector to step up with some subsidies and some programs to help accelerate that conversion,” Spencer said.
For the last 10 to 15 years, Davis said historic buildings in St. Paul have been turned into or are in the process of becoming housing and hotels.
“I see that trend continuing, although the inventory of buildings that are available to be converted to housing has dwindled because a lot of that has already occurred,” Davis said. “But there’s probably still room for more of that.”
TKDA’s plans are, of course, still a loss for St. Paul. Since its founding in the city in 1910, TKDA has maintained a considerable and noticeable presence in downtown.
 


 


“The folks over there have been great for downtown St. Paul, and they’ve been involved,” Spencer said. “It’s a little bit heartbreaking to lose a long-time presence downtown.”
Colliers’ Davis noted that the company has “been looking for something a bit more efficient with their programming and looking for maybe some greater variety of amenities nearby.” The move is in line with dozens of other firms’ efforts to downsize their office presence in the hybrid era.
Though TKDA leaving is a loss for St. Paul, Spencer thinks it can be viewed as a step towards a more vibrant area.
“We’re sad to see them go,” Spencer said. “But, at the same time, this disruption and the changes that are coming to downtown St. Paul, are also something I think if we manage this moment, the right way, the future is very exciting for downtown.”

Most kids have already finished the school year and those that haven’t will largely do so this week. 
But it’s not summer vacation for the founders of 
Camperoni
. The Minneapolis-based website that has gathered a list of more than 6,000 camps for summer, spring and winter break and off-days from school offered by 340 providers has plenty going on. 
For one, many families out there are still fine-tuning their summer schedules, either looking to add one more week of camp for their kids or subtracting a few days after realizing their original plans didn’t fit the budget, said CEO and co-founder Meredith Englund. 
 


 


But for another, Camperoni is working to add new features to its website and for new metro areas in which to expand in the months ahead.
“Right now, we’re working on what are those next cities we are going to enter and making sure we have the right camp providers in the cities already on the site by the time that people are signing up,” Englund said, adding that here locally, “We believe there will be a swell of families where their kid goes through the first week of camp and doesn’t like it as much as they had hoped, so they come back and looking for new options.”
Camperoni’s start
Camperoni allows parents to
 search for camps
 for their kids based on many filters from individual interests to cost and drop-off time to location.
 
The company got its start when Englund and co-founder Erin Anderson, whose kids go to school together, were going through the challenges of registering their kids and running into similar challenges. They met for lunch and had virtually the same idea for how to ease the process of camp signups.

Anderson is the company’s chief operating officer. After they started working toward a solution to the camp scheduling issues, Englund called a former colleague, Vasilis “Tzikis” Georgitzikis, who doesn’t have kids but has watched siblings make summer plans for his nieces and nephews. Georgitzikis, now chief technology officer, helped put together the prototype for the website and soon joined on full-time. 
 


 


The company also has a full-time associate and a team of contractors it has tapped for help as Camperoni grows. It’s still not a year old, but it quickly generated attention from the start-up community. 
Finding revenue
 
The site is currently free for both parents and for camps to be listed and the goal is to keep it that way. So, how does it make money? 
Camperoni offers premium subscriptions for camp providers who want to promote through social media and other kinds of sponsorship opportunities, Englund said. 
The site is also testing some premium parent subscriptions over the summer where, for a fee, the company will provide personalized alerts and reminders based on school district and residential location. 
 


 


The company is also working toward testing a concierge service where parents can say, “Hey, I don’t want to plan this at all. I would rather just have you guys plan it for me,” Englund said. “And we’ll go ahead and put together the full plan for you. We’ll send you all the calendar invites that you’ll need to be successful in signing up.” 
Investors intrigued
 
Camperoni quickly attracted attention from the media and from funding and networking sources. It received an investment and tax credit from the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development under the Minnesota Angel Tax Credit program. It also was a member this year of the third cohort of the Minnesota Twins Accelerator by Techstars, a partnership that focuses on advancing world-class startup companies focused on the intersection between technology, sports and entertainment. 
 


 


More recently Camperoni was named a semifinalist in the Minnesota Cup, an annual competition for emerging entrepreneurs in the state through which small businesses receive mentorship and can win prize money. 
“The Techstars accelerator was amazing,” Englund said. “It does provide funding, which is always helpful, but even more importantly, it was a way for us to turn this project into a real company.” 
 


 


The Minnesota Cup, she added, has put Camperoni in touch with some great mentors and, as the company tries to reach more parents, the recognition never hurts. 
“It’s incredibly helpful,” she said. 
Investor sees big picture
Camperoni also caught the eye of Groove Capital, an early-stage investment firm led by founder and partner, Reed Robinson, who said when he looks at potential investments, he closely studies the management team and the market opportunity. 
The trio of executives that founded Camperoni have a great combination of complementary backgrounds and work well together, he said. 
 


 


“Meredith, the CEO, is world class, really smart, very capable,” Robinson said. “She’s been around startups, around corporations, she’s got a really great pedigree in innovation and understanding where trends are pointing.” 
Robinson is also really excited about the market opportunity. The challenging nature of camp registrations is real. But Robinson said the technology, once tested and perfected, has the potential to ease more than just where the kids spend the summer. 
“Camps are where they are starting and this is an acute need that has some very real consequences if you’re not organized,” he said. “But the bigger idea is essentially using the technology to better manage the whole life schedule of your kids.” 
Doctor’s appointments, dentist’s appointments, haircuts and any other scheduling dilemmas can be eased with the same type of artificial intelligence driving Camperoni’s initial camp programming. 
“In every parent’s situation, you’re probably looking at (multiple) hours a week that are put into really being the executive assistant for your kids,” Robinson said. “The vision around leveraging voice and AI and other modern tools to better manage the kids’ needs and calendars is pretty exciting.” 
Englund confirmed that Camperoni will soon be adding after school activities and sports leagues to its offerings as it works to both expand into other markets and build a “hyperlocal marketplace for kid-related activities.” 
“In the future we can expand to everything from planning parties and play dates to making flu shot appointments and more,” she said. “We want to take the mental load of parenting out of your brain and put it on your phone.”

A coalition of police accountability advocates is seeking other avenues for community control of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) after its citizen petition to amend the city charter was rejected for not having enough verified signatures.
The ballot initiative would have asked voters whether to amend the city charter to create the Civilian Police Accountability Commission (CPAC), an independent, elected body of commissioners with the power to change MPD policies, conduct investigations into police misconduct allegations and issue discipline that could include termination of any officers including the chief. 
Jess Sundin of Twin Cities Coalition for Justice said the initiative was driven by listening to families who have had loved ones killed by police who feel there is a severe lack of accountability. She said the investigations into those fatal encounters also being handled by law enforcement constitutes a conflict of interest and lack of independence, which the initiative would aim to prevent. 
 


 


“We felt like this was a path to actually change that and empower community members to lead those investigations and lead those determinations and really put that power back into the hands of community members,” Sundin said.

In order for a citizen petition to make it onto the ballot, it must have a minimum number of valid voter signatures that is equal to 5% of the total amount of Minneapolis residents who voted in the most recent election, which in 2024 was 8,943 signatures. The petition would then have to be approved by the Charter Commission before the City Council steped in to approve final ballot initiative language by a July 9 deadline for the initiative to make it into the ballot.

That process was cut short, however, after the coalition  turned in a petition with more than 12,000 signatures on May 1. Just more than a week later on May 9, City Clerk Casey Carl, whose office is tasked with verifying signatures for such petitions, told council members that his office could only verify around 5,500 of the signatures, leaving the petition almost 3,400 signatures short of the required threshold. 
The coalition then had until May 20 to submit the remaining signatures to reach the required number. They gathered more signatures but not enough before the deadline expired. 
 


 


The effort comes more than two years after another ballot initiative – Yes for Minneapolis – that aimed to shift authority over MPD from the mayor to the city council under a new Department of Public Safety. Minneapolis voters rejected the ballot question during the 2021 municipal elections, though it came close to succeeding, receiving about 44% of the vote. 
Though the petition comes a few years after the Yes for Minneapolis initiative, the coalition began working on the CPAC idea years before in 2017. After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the idea evolved into a citizen petition and the coalition has been gathering signatures since.

The commission is inspired by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) in Chicago, which was created in 2016 and has the power to conduct investigations into police misconduct complaints and killings by officers. 
Michelle Phelps, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, said challenges to the Minneapolis charter to change the city’s power structure go back to the 1960s, but anti-police violence and police accountability groups using that method is relatively new. Phelps said the method is good for trying to force the city’s hand by putting the measure up for a vote but where it falls short is laying out what the commission would do and whether the community would be involved in shaping it. 
 


 


“There’s not that much that goes into the city charter. It’s like a series of rules and protocols more than it is (a) fleshed-out policy that really gets into the nitty gritty of design,” she said. “And it’s a blunt tool in the sense that the public really only has the option of a yes or no vote once it gets to the point where it’s on the ballot.”
Sundin said the coalition is examining their options as they move forward, though they have ruled out legally challenging the city clerk’s analysis of the signatures. 
Related | Minneapolis fails to get council buy-in on former Third Precinct proposal
Due to the more progressive makeup of the City Council, the coalition is now considering asking council members to use their powers to put the initiative on the ballot. Though they did not meet the threshold number of signatures, the extra signatures collected before May 20 was to show council members that residents support the idea. The council can either amend the charter by ordinance, which requires unanimous support from the council and mayoral approval, or it can refer a proposed amendment to voters, which is still subject to review by the Charter Commission, but can make it on the ballot with a veto-proof majority.
“We wanted to convey to our elected representatives that there is broad support for this that hasn’t died down even though George Floyd was killed just over four years ago, that people still want to see real changes and don’t feel like waiting for consent decrees or appointed commissioners is enough,” she said.

The family of Ricky Cobb II expressed dismay on Tuesday at the decision by Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty to drop the charges against the Minnesota State Trooper who fatally shot the 33-year-old Black man during a routine traffic stop last summer.
The family is now calling for a Department of Justice investigation into the Minnesota State Patrol. 
“I’ve said this once before – justice? I knew that wasn’t going to happen,” said Ricky Cobb Sr., Cobb’s father. “The truth came out. Our taxpayer dollars pay for untrained, armed police officers to run these streets to protect us.”
 


 


Moriarty announced Sunday evening that her office filed a motion to drop the charges against Trooper Ryan Londregan after new evidence would have made it “impossible” for prosecutors to prove Londregan’s use of force was unauthorized. Specifically, she cited prospective testimony from Londregan that he saw Cobb reach for the other trooper’s gun during the altercation, and the claim from a Minnesota State Patrol trainer that he never instructed officers to avoid shooting into moving vehicles.

The combination of those pieces of evidence would have prevented the prosecution from meeting the burden of proof to convict Londregan, she said.
“There are so many points at which Mr. Londregan could have handled the situation differently, and if he had, Ricky Cobb might still be alive. But that is not the question before us as prosecutors,” Moriarty said. “The only question is whether we can still prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime occurred given this new evidence. The answer to that question is no, and I would violate my ethical duties if I nonetheless continued with the case.”
Londregan was charged with – and pleaded not guilty to – second-degree unintentional murder, second-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault. 
 


 


Cobb was killed during a traffic stop last July on Interstate 94 in north Minneapolis where he was stopped for non functioning taillights. The troopers on the scene then learned Cobb had a warrant for his arrest for violating a protective order in Ramsey County. 
After refusing to exit his car, two troopers, including Londregan, reached into the vehicle to pull him out. The car started moving when Londregan shot into the vehicle, killing Cobb.

“I’ve never been part of a case where an individual was charged with a crime then articulated his own defense, and then the prosecution says ‘hey we’re going to dismiss these charges because of what you’ve told us,’” said Bakari Sellers, a civil rights attorney representing Cobb’s family.
Moriarty said outside factors – including the killing of Minneapolis Police Officer Jamal Mitchell in the line of duty last week, and rumors that Gov. Tim Walz would take the case away from her office – did not have an effect on her decision to drop the charges. But she did criticize Walz for openly musing about whether he would intervene and reassign the case and said Tuesday that she believes the governor treats her differently because of her sexual orientation. 
 


 


Walz earlier this week flatly denied those claims. 
The Cobb family, however, believes Mitchell’s death last week did have a part to play in Moriarty’s decision to drop the charges against Londregan, citing the 
politicization of the case in recent months
 by elected officials and law enforcement organizations. 
Sellers said a federal civil lawsuit is still moving forward, and called on the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, which has investigated dozens of police departments across the country – including the Minneapolis Police Department following the murder of George Floyd – to step in and examine the State Patrol. 
“I don’t think there’s any more glaring example of a department that needs to be investigated in the Minnesota State Patrol,” Sellers said. “We’re asking them to do that because if this continues, then you’ll have more innocent people killed and one of the things that I won’t do and this family won’t do is allow Ricky’s legacy to be in vain.”

This story was originally published by 
Twin Cities Business
.
 


Red Lake Nation College
 is set to open a new location in downtown Minneapolis, marking the first tribal college located in a major urban area.
With construction completed on the new $16.2 million site, classes are set to begin at the three-building campus. RLNC began offering classes in Minneapolis through distance learning and temporary classroom locations in fall of 2022.
The college will host a formal opening on June 6 at 900 S. 3rd St. Minneapolis. The new location sits one block north of the U.S. Bank Stadium in the former Tiger Oak Media headquarters.
 


 


“We need doctors, lawyers, teachers, social workers, business managers, accountants,” said RLNC President Dan King. “Education is such an important way for us to ensure our survival as a tribe.”
The expansion was financed by the college’s fundraising, federal funding, and a $3 million grant from the state of Minnesota after the project cost continued to grow during the Covid-19 pandemic, King said.
Native-owned firm 
Full Circle Planning
 and architecture firm 
Firm Ground
 were involved in the design and planning of the new site.
King said the college will have an additional revenue source from renting out the building for corporate meetings, weddings, or Vikings events, given its proximity to the stadium.
 


 


The expansion was prompted by demand from members of Red Lake Nation living in the Twin Cities for a tribal college they could attend close to home, King said. Half of Red Lake Nation’s 16,000 members live outside of its reservation in northern Minnesota, and most are in the Twin Cities metro area.

Ojibwe language, culture, and values are weaved in the learning at RLNC, King said.
“A lot of our Native people —and this is true all around the country — haven’t usually had a good experience with education,” King said. “Our history and our language is totally left out.”
Seventy percent of the college’s staff and faculty are Native. For many of the students, it’s their first time having an instructor who is also Native, King said.
 


 


Bringing a culture-based education option to Natives in the Twin Cities has helped RLNC grow enrollment by about 35% per year, King said. Enrollment is open to anyone with a high school diploma or GED, and thanks to online-flexible class formats, the college also serves Native students as far away as New York, Florida, and Michigan.
King said he thinks the college will continue to grow at its current rate for a few years, likely leveling off at 500 or 700 students per year to maintain small class sizes and one-on-one attention.
RLNC offers a dual-enrollment program for high schoolers to start earning college credit, King said. Its partnership with Red Lake High School enrolled about 45 students at one point prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Robbinsdale and Roseville school districts are currently partners in the college’s 
postsecondary enrollment option
 program in the Twin Cities. King said the college aims to expand to work with other districts.
Many students come in with ninth or tenth grade level educations, and King said the college spends time playing catch-up to ensure they can graduate with an associate’s degree and enter the workforce or transfer to schools like the University of Minnesota, Augsburg University, and Dartmouth College.
 


 


 


 


“We don’t want them to just get a two-year degree and stop. We want them to get a four-year, a master’s, or a professional degree, and then come back and help their communities,” King said.
Many students from the Red Lake campus go on to study within the Minnesota State University system, while Metropolitan State University and Augsburg University are common transfer outcomes in the Twin Cities, King said. RLNC has transfer articulation agreements with all public universities and some private colleges in Minnesota, allowing students to apply all earned credits to their new degree program.
Augsburg University offers free tuition for Native students, and those enrolled at the University of Minnesota with household incomes below $125,000 can also attend for free.
The college’s higher learning commission accreditation means they have to meet the same standards as schools like the University of Minnesota.
 


 


“We want to make sure that our students aren’t wasting their time, and anything they get here, they can transfer it to wherever they want to go,” King said.
After graduating, all students have either transferred to a four-year school or started a job and earned $10,000 more per year than when they first enrolled, King said.
Students with college graduates in their family can ask for help filling out forms and navigating classes, but many RLNC students are the first-gen and lack that support, King said.
“Our staff and faculty are like the uncles, the aunts, and the parents who went to college. We all help,” King said.
Part of that close connection is having small classes — 12 to 15 students on average — as well as having each student assigned to a staff member for individual meetings to ensure they are doing well academically and personally, King said.
“Our secret recipe is one-on-one attention,” King said.
King said students from other tribes share many of the same values and are welcomed as much as members of the Red Lake Nation, and after they graduate, they’re encouraged to go back and help their communities.
“It’s a win-win situation for all of us,” King said.
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct the name of the architecture firm involved in the project.

As the cost of living rises, many cities have looked to housing density to increase affordability. 
This is because when supply is limited, costs skyrocket as seen in cities like New York City and Los Angeles. 
While Minneapolis is no New York, the city has made a concerted effort to adapt zoning and infrastructure to meet population. This was a major focus of the city’s 
2040 Plan
, which includes a provision that allows duplexes and triplexes in areas that had previously only allowed single-family detached houses without additional approvals. 
 


 


But some development has been blocked as litigation continued around a 
lawsuit
 filed in 2018 by Smart Growth Minneapolis. The lawsuit claims the city needed to do environmental assessments on the impacts of the population growth on water supply, sewage systems, air and noise pollution, before establishing its comprehensive plan. City officials have argued that these reviews are applied to new developments but should not be applied simply to the framework around where these developments can occur. 
However, this lawsuit may soon come to an end – or not. It will come down to the decision of a judge. After the close of the legislative session, advocates for the 2040 Plan celebrated what they call a win for the future of housing density in Minneapolis. But plaintiffs in the case deny that the state bill’s language will lead to the dismissal of their case, saying it isn’t effectively retroactive for all claims against the defendants. 
Lawsuit and legislation 
The Minneapolis 2040 Plan had been fully implemented from a regulatory perspective as soon as a land use rezoning study went into effect July 1 of last year. This was the final of a series of zoning code amendments since 2020 that brought the city’s zoning regulations into alignment with the Minneapolis 2040 Plan. 
The city was forced to stop enforcement of certain aspects of its comprehensive plan and zoning code as a result of the injunction issued by the district court in September of last year. That injunction was reversed by the Court of Appeals in May, which allowed the city to immediately resume enforcement of the adopted Minneapolis 2040 Plan and zoning code.

The work that happened in the legislature is meant to represent more than just Minneapolis, said Peter Wagenius, the Sierra Club’s legislative director. The legislation applies to the entire seven-county metro area in granting assurances that plans that increase density can’t be held up in court or trigger expensive environmental studies, he said. 
Peter Wagenius
“I’m really proud of the environmental community for leading on this bill,” Wagenius said. “Environmental law was being used against the environment and we put a stop to that. Both for the state of climate and housing, this is an important victory.”
Other legislative bills related to land use reform and housing didn’t pass this year including 
a measure that would have made it it easier to build multi-family housing in commercially zoned areas
 and a bill dubbed the “missing middle” bill 
that would have required larger cities to allow duplexes, triplexes and four-plexes in what has been zoned for single-family housing. 
“We know that the ‘missing middle’ (bill) and other bills didn’t pass,” Wagenius said. “This did pass and it’s a victory we can build on.” 
 


 


As for the claim that the bill isn’t retroactive, Wagenius said, “The wording of the new laws are clear. The court is more than capable of reading the words as written.”
The language that could end the lawsuit can be found in a couple of paragraphs within the 1,400 page bill passed through the Legislature and later signed by Gov. Tim Walz. One paragraph states that comprehensive plans adopted in “the most recent decennial review” and for “subsequent reviews” by cities are not subject to legal challenges under the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act, or MERA, which allows Minnesotans to sue on behalf of the land and water.

The plaintiffs’ attorney, Jack Perry, said this legislation does not actually apply retroactively to moot the case, based on the plain language of the new law and precedent. 
“No matter how much they stomp their feet or pound their desk it doesn’t apply,” Perry said. 
 


 


Rep. Mike Howard, DFL-Richfield, said the language is “quite clear” and is effectively retroactive because it specified comprehensive plans from “the most recent decennial review.”
 


 


“That was also the clear legislative intent based on what we worked on all session,” he said.  
Within the next week, the plaintiffs in the case plan to file a petition with the Minnesota Supreme Court arguing that the May 13 Court of Appeals decision was incorrect and the new legislation does not moot the legal case. The city will then have 21 days to file a response brief explaining why the Supreme Court should deny review. The Supreme Court will decide whether to grant review of the case or not, but that process may take a couple months to play out.
“The Minnesota Legislature and Governor approved legislation clarifying that the City’s adoption of the 2040 comprehensive plan does not violate MERA. Accordingly, the City has asked the plaintiffs to voluntarily stipulate to the dismissal of their MERA lawsuit. The City is awaiting a response from the plaintiffs,” read a statement from the City of Minneapolis.

The litigation has also made it difficult to track the impact of the city’s comprehensive plan, according to a report by The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, which created a dashboard 
to track housing density following the adoption of the 2040 plan. 
The report states the Hennepin County District Court order that blocked the use of some aspects of the 2040 Plan as of Nov. 4, has been a “key barrier to observing further impacts” of the city’s comprehensive plan. 
Construction of multifamily housing in Minneapolis was strong from the late 2010s through the 2020s, peaking at 4,646 new units permitted in 2019, just prior to the implementation of a city 
zoning policy
 that required affordable units within new housing developments, according to the report.

However, the Minneapolis Fed’s dashboard shows no statistically significant difference in the volume of multifamily housing construction compared to what would have happened with or without the city’s 2040 Plan. 
For the “new multifamily housing” indicator in particular, the lagged implementation of three key policies may have delayed the plan’s full effects, according to the report.
In January of 2021, one year after the 2040 Plan took effect, the city implemented its built form policies, which are a set of city-wide zoning overlay districts regulating attributes of any residential structure built in the city, including height, floor area, and lot size. In May of 2021, the city completely eliminated parking minimums for new construction. And in July of 2023, Minneapolis adopted its 
Land Use Rezoning Study
, which aligned zoning districts with the direction of the 2040 Plan and streamlined the regulatory process for new housing.
Outside of reevaluating single-family zoning, the 2040 Plan also addressed larger housing developments, particularly in and around downtown. The plan added multiple 
zoning districts
 that increase the amount of housing that can be constructed near transit and along commercial corridors. Another provision in the plan establishes height minimum requirements for new developments downtown.

As the summer begins to get into full swing, warmer and more humid days are on the horizon, say climate and weather scientists. 
Temperatures across Minnesota this summer have a 30% to 40% chance of being higher than normal, according to a seasonal outlook issued by the National Weather Service earlier this month. The anticipated higher temperatures are in line with a trend that has shown rising temperatures year over year, said Senior Climatologist Kenny Blumenfeld with the Department of Natural Resources, 
but the increase is more gradual compared to 
how winters are warming.
“On average, winter is warming – depending on where you look and how you look at it – three to five times faster than summer,” Blumenfeld said. “So summer is warming, meaning a typical summer now is warmer than a typical summer 30, 50 or 100 years ago, but it’s just not as dramatically warm now compared to then like what we see with winters.”

The problem, Blumenfeld said, is that the dew point – which is how humidity is measured and refers to the temperature at which the air can hold no more water – is increasing more dramatically. Recent years have seen more and more spikes in dew point, and the combination of higher temperatures with higher humidity, known as the heat index, is what makes days feel hotter than they’ve ever been and can cause unsafe conditions.
Blumenfeld said Minnesota goes through dry and wet periods that can each last years at a time. The state has been afflicted by drier conditions during the past few years, leading to drought conditions that have caused issues for Minnesota farmers. 
Long term, however, conditions are getting gradually more wet. The 2010s were the wettest decade on record, capped off by the wettest single year on record in 2019, and dry conditions today look similar to wet conditions decades earlier. With rising global temperatures caused by climate change, increased moisture contributes to the higher humidity levels and more precipitation, Blumenfeld said. 
“As global temperatures increase, more water is evaporated off of the oceans. When water is evaporated off of the oceans, it goes into the air, water in the air is known as water vapor or humidity, and we experience it as humidity,” he said. “That’s actually the fuel for both our humidity driven heat waves – those hot muggy days that have become more common – and also for passing weather systems that use that moisture to generate precipitation.”
 


 


 


 


The higher humidity makes it more difficult for the human body to cool itself by sweating, which can lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Alongside temperatures, the amount of heat-related deaths nationwide have been increasing every year, with just more than 1,600 in 2021, more than 1,722 in 2022 and about 2,300 in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease a control and Prevention. 
Jason Urbanczyk, a community engagement fellow for the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless, said he sees many cases of heat exhaustion and other heat-related conditions in the summers during his advocacy work in Moorhead. 
“A lot of people think that with the encampments, only the wintertime is bad, but in terms of safety, the summertime is when things can get a lot worse,” he said. 
Urbanczyk said not much work has been done on the effects of climate change on unhoused populations and that his group will be studying the issue going forward. In the short-term, more funding for facilities where unhoused people can stay cool during heat waves can be a solution, he said, but housing should still be the long term goal. 
 


 


“Providing more places for people to be inside, that they’re going to be allowed to be inside without being hassled, because I’m sure you know how it is when people try to go in places and hang out and they’re unwelcome,” he said. “Other than that, the ultimate solution, of course, is to get more housing for people to get them off the streets and inside is really what we need.”
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect temperatures across Minnesota this summer have a 30% to 40% chance of being higher than normal, rather than are expected to be 30% to 40% higher than normal.

Hidden River Middle School has served thousands of students for the past century in St. Paul’s Macalester-Groveland neighborhood. Now, the outdated features of the school — formerly known as Ramsey Middle School — have given way to a $54.2 million energy-efficient renovation highlighted during a groundbreaking ceremony Thursday. 
St. Paul Public Schools hopes to finish the project by the fall of 2025. The district said in a press release that the renovation aims to provide students, families, faculty and community members with a “premier learning environment that will enrich St. Paul for decades to come.”

“The overarching goal of the renovation of Hidden River is to modernize our 100-year-old building to fully support what middle school students need today and into the future,” Principal Teresa Vibar said in an email exchange with MinnPost. “This is a comprehensive investment in the building to make sure it supports high-quality teaching and learning, has high performing building systems, and meets the district’s goals for environmental stewardship.”
 


 


After the renovation, Hidden River will be the second school in the district to utilize a natural aquifer to fuel the system and the third to use geothermal technology to heat and cool the building. It will be one of 15 SPPS schools with inclusive bathrooms. 
Other additions designed to improve the building’s energy and environmental features include high-performing air handling units with energy recovery, energy-efficient LED light fixtures and lighting controls, insulation within existing exterior walls and roofs and window and light replacements, the district said.

A new Summit Avenue entrance into the school will “preserve the building’s historical features and unify designs from past remodels,” the release said. The space will include undulating metal fins to provide shade while reflecting the school’s “hidden river” — the aquifer — by echoing the movement of the water. 
Vibar said another aim of the renovation is to improve school conditions while keeping its storied features intact.
 


 


“History is important,” she said. “Maintaining the historic pieces while building for the future is a big task. We have many former students who return as parents or staff members when they are adults. They will be able to recognize that this is still the same building as it was when they were students, only better.”
The school’s parking lot will be relocated from Grand Avenue to Summit Avenue, adjacent to the building’s new entrance. 
Students and faculty will relocate to the district’s Wilson building, a move that the district expects will shorten the remodeling process by two years. The LEAP High School program, the district’s school for immigrants that was formerly located at Wilson, was relocated to John A. Johnson Elementary in the fall of 2023.
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified the neighborhood in which Hidden River Middle School is located. It is in the Macalester-Groveland neighborhood.

In an industry often lacking diversity, Brittney Mikell is breaking barriers by launching the first Black woman-owned brewery in the Twin Cities. 
Mikell’s path to entrepreneurship began with a burnout from her career in healthcare. “I was a pharmacist and eventually realized that I couldn’t do it emotionally,” she said. During the pandemic, while many were experimenting with sourdough, Mikell found an interest in homebrewing. Her background in chemistry and her intuitive sense for flavors made brewing an instant passion. 
“I realized I had a real talent for it,” she said.
 


 


However, Mikell noticed a lack of diversity in the brewing community. “There were no people of color at all,” she recalled. This observation sparked her vision of creating a space that would not only serve great beer but also promote diversity and inclusivity in the industry. “I can take this fun hobby and turn it into a career that helps people.”
Starting a brewery is no small task, especially for a woman of color. She applied for numerous grants but had little success. “There are always challenges for women of color, particularly Black women, in getting access to capital,” Mikell explained.

However, the Community Entrepreneurship Program at St. Thomas provided a lifeline. This 10-month program, a collaboration between the University of St. Thomas, the Schulze School of Entrepreneurship, and the Small Business Development Center, offers hands-on support for aspiring entrepreneurs facing economic hardship.
Mikell highlighted the program’s mentorship and student consultations as particularly beneficial. “My students have been a godsend,” she said, crediting them with helping to build her 
crowdfunding campaign
 from scratch. The mentorship from professionals, even those outside her industry, also provided valuable perspectives, especially in crafting a business plan appealing to bankers.
 


 


Cameron Schulz was one of the two student consultants working with Mikell. “Brittney’s energy and motivation (was) contagious. We were able to take everything we learned in the classroom and apply it to the real world.” 
Their work, particularly in crowdfunding, was a learning curve but ultimately rewarding. “We gave her the tools to be successful, and she ran with it,” Schulz said.
Brittney Mikell hopes her brewery will be more than just a business, but a community hub as well.

Community support has been crucial in Mikell’s journey. The overwhelming backing she received from her Indiegogo campaign was a testament to this. “We set out with a goal of $20k and hit that goal in six days, ending the campaign with $27k,” she said, moved by the community’s response. This success paved the way for a larger public 
crowdfunding campaign launched last week
 aiming to raise $500k. These funds will be instrumental in acquiring essential equipment and facilitating further expansion efforts.
The funding will also support the construction of a “nature house”—a Swedish-style building designed to remain warm even in the Minnesota winters. The crowdfunding campaign is not just a local effort, it seeks to gain support beyond Minnesota, reflecting the widespread appeal and potential impact. Achieving these goals will not only enhance their capacity to serve the community but also position them for future financial stability and growth.
 


 


Mikell hopes her brewery will be more than just a business, but a community hub as well. With hopes to build in the Rondo community, an area reminiscent of her Southside Chicago roots, the brewery aims to revitalize the local spirit and foster a sense of economic empowerment among residents. “I plan on creating jobs and hiring folks from the community, paying a living wage,” she said. 
To other women of color aspiring to entrepreneurship, Mikell advises acknowledges the privilege in her journey but emphasizes the importance of resilience and taking calculated risks. “Don’t be afraid to shoot your shot. Get your ducks in order, but take the opportunity when it presents itself.”

Four years ago, George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was murdered at the hands of white then-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, and a global reckoning on racial justice ensued as millions of people took to streets around the world demanding change.

In the days and weeks following Floyd’s death, many promises were made, ranging from elected officials vowing to enact policing reforms to prevent ever-increasing deadly encounters between Black people and law enforcement, to corporations pledging millions of dollars to remedy existing disparities.
“We’ve seen some jurisdictions that have changed some of the laws and policies on their books. We also saw some philanthropic organizations and corporations make promises about a renewed focus on racial justice and equity,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a community activist and civil rights attorney. “Some of them have followed through on their promises, while many others have not.”
 


 


Policing reforms – past, present and future
Shortly after Floyd was murdered, the city announced several changes to MPD policies that included bans on chokeholds and neck restraints, requiring officers to report or intervene if their colleagues use unreasonable force and changing how use of force is documented by officers. In the following years, more Black men were killed in encounters with law enforcement, and outrage from community members helped usher in more policy changes in Minneapolis.

The killing of 20-year-old motorist Daunte Wright by a Brooklyn Center police officer in 2021 during Derek Chauvin’s murder trial led Minneapolis to place limits on pretextual stops, preventing MPD officers from initiating traffic stops based solely on things like expired tabs or an item dangling from a rearview mirror. The fatal shooting of Amir Locke by a Minneapolis SWAT team member during a no-knock raid on a downtown Minneapolis apartment in February 2022 prompted a 
ban on unannounced no-knock warrants
 by MPD officers.
Leslie Redmond, president of the Minneapolis NAACP chapter during the time of Floyd’s murder, said she and other community members can recognize how those policy changes are an improvement. But the continued killings of Black men at the hands of law enforcement shows “a lack of appreciation and respect for Black lives.”
“I don’t think we should expect for it to change and transform overnight, but we have to acknowledge that people’s lives are being lost overnight,” she said. “It’s a delicate dance because on one note, we know that we’re making steps in the right direction somewhat, but there’s still a lot of work to be done and people are dying.”
 


 


Going forward, work on further reforms will be directed by court-enforceable agreements prompted by investigations by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights (MDHR) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). 
Both investigations found that the department had engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminatory policing. The city has now entered into court-enforceable agreements with both state and federal agencies, known as a consent decree, and the comprehensive implementation of police change and reform is now underway. Effective Law Enforcement For All (ELEFA), a nonprofit team made up of former police officials and attorneys, has been selected as the court-appointed independent evaluator for the agreements and will monitor the progress of the city in implementing the changes laid out in the agreements.

Levy Armstrong called the consent decree a major step toward change within the Minneapolis Police Department. Though the agreements are forward-looking and won’t hold officers accountable for past misconduct, community members are hopeful the process will lead to long lasting changes.
“It’s disheartening to know that some of the officers won’t be held accountable for the harm that they caused,” she said. “At the same time, people have some hope because they know that MPD will be monitored for many years to come and the courts will be involved in that process, which is something new that I feel demonstrates some level of progress.”
 


 


Policing policy efforts
Lawmakers on the city, state and federal levels pledged to use legislation to remedy the problems with law enforcement that were laid bare by George Floyd’s murder. 
In the days after Floyd was killed by Chauvin, nine council members got on a stage and pledged to dismantle the police department. Of those nine council members, seven are no longer on the council due to either failing to hold onto their seats in the municipal elections held the following year or opting not to run again.

The pledge to dismantle MPD evolved into a ballot question that would have reorganized city government by placing the police department under a new “Department of Public Safety,” shifting control of the department from Mayor Jacob Frey to the council in an effort to more directly legislate reforms. The ballot initiative failed in 2021, and control over the department remains with the mayor. 
On the state level, the Legislature passed a police accountability package less than two months after Floyd was killed that included a ban on neck restraints, an end to “warrior”-style training and the addition of two citizen members to the Peace Officer Standards and Training Board. Critics of the legislation said it didn’t go far enough, but lawmakers at the time called it a first step. 
 


 


That package was followed by another during a 2021 special session, which centered around restrictions on no-knock warrants but also featured requirements for 911 operators to refer mental health crisis calls to non-police response teams. It also included a few million dollars in funding for body cameras, as well as community safety and youth violence intervention initiatives.  
In both cases, the packages that passed were much smaller compromises than what was initially introduced, whittled down by lawmakers in the Senate, which was controlled by Republicans at the time.

The reforms that have been passed are nowhere near enough, said Johnathon McClellan, who as president of the Minnesota Justice Coalition (MJC) has brought several police accountability proposals to lawmakers.
 
Though most of the provisions that were passed, like restrictions on chokeholds and no-knock warrants, are to prevent deadly police encounters going forward, none of the provisions provide any avenues for accountability, he said.
“This is what the community wants, this is what they’ve been marching for and this is what we’ve been hoping for since May 25, 2020 (the day Floyd was killed),” he said. “Yet here we are today and the Legislature cannot point to one piece of legislation that provides accountability.”
 


 


Democrats won a majority of seats in both chambers during the midterm elections in November 2022, and DFL Gov. Tim Walz was also reelected. When the first legislative session with a DFL trifecta began in early 2023, McClellan said he and the coalition brought those proposals to lawmakers, like ending qualified immunity, removing the statute of limitations on wrongful death lawsuits against officers and making it so convicted law enforcement officers lose the tax-funded portions of their pensions.
But, he said, there has been no appetite among legislative leaders for more progressive police reform legislation.
“Everyone went quiet and a lot of people that used the name of George Floyd and others who lost their lives to police violence as part of their campaign slogans or literature or as part of their speeches, those people are nowhere to be found,” he said.
In Congress, federal lawmakers in 2020 put together the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which boosts body camera use by officers, bans most uses of no-knock warrants and chokeholds, and puts limits on the use of qualified immunity, among other provisions. The legislation passed in the Democrat-controlled House in 2021 but stalled in the Senate. 
There was a push to revive the bill following the death of Tyre Nichols, who died days after a violent traffic stop where five Memphis police officers repeatedly beat and kicked the 29-year-old Black man. But the bill remains tabled to this day. 
As years pass, corporate promises dwindle 
Some Black business owners have seen a decrease in the number of partnerships and sponsorships that flooded in immediately after George Floyd was killed – and the subsequent uprisings – according to local business owner and media personality Sheletta Brundidge. 
Sheletta Brundidge
“Some companies based here in the Twin Cities invested in Black business owners only as long as someone was watching,” she said. 
Many parts of the world have returned to “business as usual,” said the owner of production company 
ShelettaMakesMeLaugh.com
. In the first few years after George Floyd, Brundidge was sponsored by Target, General Mills, Bremer Bank, Comcast, UnitedHealthcare and other major corporations. Of those companies, Comcast, Bremer Bank and UnitedHealthcare are the only major companies that stuck around, she said. 
“We have all seen a drop in our funding, in our partnerships, in our sponsorships now that we are four years out from George Floyd’s death,” Brundidge said. “There was some progress made but not the progress that we saw a year after he died, two years after he died, and even three years after he died.”
 


 


Even in those first years following Floyd’s death, it was a fight to hold companies accountable. Brundidge was only sponsored by 
Target, General Mills, and other companies in 2022 after she called out local corporations for not fulfilling promises made after Floyd’s murder
. Now, once again, she said she’s been told by many companies that they are “going in a different direction.”
“We thought things would change,” Brundidge said of the promises made. “We hired staff. We went out and bought brick and mortar. We saw a boost in our partnerships, and we were overdelivering, and we were doing a good job and giving them more than what they paid for. Then came the day they were going to renew with us and some of them did not.” 
In order to create lasting change, people need to take on the challenge together, Brundidge said. She pointed to Black Entrepreneurs Day at the state Capitol, 
a day when Black business owners converge in St. Paul at the State Capitol to speak with state legislators about support needed. 
This year was the second year the event was held, drawing around 500 people, she said. 
The day is about having a seat at the table where decisions are made, Brundidge said.  
“That’s the change,” she said. “The change is we’ve realized what we’re worth. The change is strength in numbers. The change is we’re coming out as a collective and saying, ‘Nope we’re not going back. We’re going to go join you over there.’”  
Police in the Third Precinct 
There hasn’t been a permanent post for police in the city’s Third Precinct since the former building was destroyed during the uprising that followed George Floyd’s murder. But, this year, plans are beginning to take form around the future of both the former building and a new Third Precinct location, though not without tension and debate. 
After sitting empty and surrounded by barbed wire for four years, the city came to the Minneapolis City Council this year with a proposal to turn the former Third Precinct building at 3000 Minnehaha Ave. into a “democracy center.” This was met with pushback, as the city was only asking council for its proverbial blessing. Ultimately, 
council voted against approving the plan, asking the city to engage in broader community engagement before bringing a plan to them. 
The city is moving forward with cleanup of the site this spring. Mayor Jacob Frey has said the city will also move forward with plans to continue community engagement about its proposal for a democracy center, despite not garnering council buy-in.

One thing that was decided by council last year was 
that police will not return to the former Third Precinct station
, so the city’s new Office of Community Safety has been working to find a new building to house police. The office is considering two “community safety centers.” One permanent South Minneapolis Community Safety Center will house police at a building on 2633 Minnehaha Ave., though the city has yet to close on this property. Another temporary Lake Street Safety Center that will be smaller, has yet to have a location announced and will only have funding for around two years, but also will not house police.

Unlike plans for 3000 Minnehaha, spring community outreach and discussions around these community safety centers have included a broad range of possibilities including addiction services, food security programs, mental health resources, youth programming, harm reduction programming and economic support. Discussions started at the end of March and will close this Friday so the city can compile what it’s heard from area residents, said Director of Community Safety Design and Implementation Amanda Harrington during a Wednesday engagement session. 
The Office of Community Safety is a relatively new department in Minneapolis, as is Harrington’s role in it. 
“When I say that I have been brought on board to deal with design and implementation, what I’m designing is actually a community safety ecosystem,” Harrington said during the Wednesday meeting.

The office was created in 2022 during a government restructuring within the city. The office aims to collaborate and communicate between safety departments in the city that were previously run separately and worked independently of each other including 911, emergency management, fire, neighborhood safety and the police department.
“We’re all kind of figuring out how to work together because in the past, these departments have been really separate and have worked on their own,” Harrington said. 
Deaths since George Floyd 
While George Floyd’s killing placed a spotlight on Minneapolis and Minnesota, Floyd was not the first Black man to be killed at the hands of police and he wasn’t the last. 
Black Americans remain more than twice as likely to be killed by police, according to the 
Mapping Police Violence
 project. 
Unarmed Black residents who have been killed at the hands of police in Minnesota since George Floyd include: Dolal Idd in Minneapolis in December of 2020, Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center in April of 2021, Leneal Frazier in Minneapolis in July of 2021, Amir Locke in Minneapolis in February of 2022 and Ricky Cobb II in July of 2023.

In a groundbreaking initiative at Dunwoody College of Technology, students are reshaping the landscape of community engagement through a unique course called “Community Connect.” Created by instructor Alonso Sierralta, the program blends education with hands-on community service, offering students a transformative learning experience while making a tangible impact on those in need.
Inspired by a personal connection with 
Bridging
, a local nonprofit dedicated to providing household items to families facing housing instability, Sierralta envisioned a course that would not only teach practical skills but also instill a sense of empathy and social responsibility in his students.
“When we see furniture, we don’t often see how it was made,” Sierralta explained. “The idea is for students to understand the mechanics behind design and construction, while also contributing to the community in a meaningful way.”
 


 


Student Courtney Berghorst shared her motivation for enrolling in the course: “I wanted to do something that had to do with the community and help out.”

The redesigned furniture pieces, created with meticulous care and creativity, find their way to families in need through Bridging. “I hope those pieces of furniture get taken by a good family, which I think would be wonderful,” Sierralta shared. “They are strong, they are good pieces, and there’s a great message behind the whole experience.”

Berghorst also emphasized the significance of where their work goes. “It’s really great that people who don’t have a lot and are moving into a new place can go to Bridging and pick out something that fits their aesthetic, making their home feel personal and welcoming without having to spend a ton of money.”
Jennifer Baker, Bridging’s marketing manager, shared insights on the nonprofit’s impact on families and the importance of programs like Community Connect. “It can be hard to define the impact the project has on a family because, yes, technically we’re just giving out furniture. But you know, a bed can be a lot more than just a bed to somebody. It’s a place to rest, its safety, its comfort. A dining room table is more than a piece of furniture; it’s a place for a family to gather, where kids can do their homework. Furniture can really make a house a home and signify a new chapter for families transitioning out of housing instability.”
 


 


 


 


Reflecting on the broader impact of the project, Sierralta echoed Baker on the impact the furniture has on families. “These pieces are more than just furniture; they symbolize hope and stability. Our students’ efforts help families create homes that reflect their dignity and aspirations, and that’s incredibly rewarding for everyone involved.”
Baker recalled one family who came to Bridging before Christmas with her two young kids and was able to leave with a whole household setup including couches, dishes, a table, and beds.
“She sent us photos a few days later of her kids jumping on the couch next to the Christmas tree, just so happy to have a place they could finally call home,” Baker said.
Bringing old furniture back to life
Throughout the semester, students like Berghorst embarked on a journey of creativity and collaboration, tasked with redesigning furniture donated by Bridging. From disassembling old sewing machines to repurposing discarded bookshelves, each project was a testament to the students’ creativity and dedication to making a difference.

“We took that just because we thought it’d be interesting to take it apart and see what we had to work with,” Berghorst recounted, describing her team’s transformation of an old sewing machine into a modern side table.
Baker also praised the Community Connect class’s efforts. “I love that they’ve taken on the task of giving new life to pieces of furniture. It’s fantastic to see this level of care for the community. Additionally, we are proud of the environmental impact – keeping 14 million pounds out of landfills every year. Taking furniture that might be borderline usable and transforming it into something truly beautiful shows a wonderful commitment to the community.”
For Berghorst and her peers, the experience was not just about learning new skills but also about understanding the profound impact of community service. “It feels awesome. It makes me want to do more.”

Lack of progress and failures in transparency were among the main concerns expressed by Minneapolis residents Tuesday night during a public hearing held by the city’s Community Commission on Police Oversight (CCPO). 
The hearing was the first conducted by the commission since holding its initial meeting more than a year ago. The 15-member body was created in an effort to overhaul the city’s existing police oversight, which critics said was impotent, ineffective and purposely hindered by city officials when the body stopped holding meetings for months due to failures to fill vacancies. 
But problems and criticisms of inefficiency have also plagued this iteration of police oversight. The CCPO has made no policy recommendations yet, and they’ve conducted few review panels amid a backlog of nearly 200 misconduct complaints within the Office of Police Conduct Review.

Michelle Hofeldt, a Phillips West resident, told the commissioners they were frustrated that among the commission’s duties was to make policy recommendations to Minneapolis Police Department Chief Brian O’Hara, but after a year of existence the body has yet to make a single recommendation. 
“I don’t think that the CCPO has enough power because you can only make recommendations and that has been a problem with previous civilian oversight boards – they make a recommendation and the (MPD) chief ignores it – but you’re not even making recommendations,” they said. “That’s eroding public trust in you and that’s eroding public trust further in police accountability.”

Several speakers said community input didn’t seem to be a priority for commissioners, citing the decision to put the public comment portion at the very end of their regular meetings. Another point of contention on transparency brought by residents to the commissioners was the formation of the CCPO’s work groups, the subcommittees of the commission. The work groups aren’t official committees so they aren’t subject to open meeting laws, promoting concern from many residents who are invested in the police oversight process.  
 


 


“I cannot imagine a public body in the city of Minneapolis in 2024, that deals with police-related issues, that sees some legitimacy in meeting in private,” said Ward 6 resident Chuck Turchik. “That is astounding.”
 


 


At the start of the meeting, commissioners gave an overview of the CCPO’s duties and gave updates on the progress of their various work groups. The commission’s duties include researching police policies, assessing training and misconduct data and making recommendations to the city council, mayor or O’Hara. Commissioners also sit on review panels made up of three civilians and two officers that go over misconduct cases and decide whether to recommend discipline to the chief. 
Commissioner Mara Schanfield said her policy research work group has been reviewing policies of similar cities under consent decrees. She’s also been working with consent decree monitor Effective Law Enforcement For All (ELEFA) and MPD’s Implementation Unit to ensure the commission has a part in police policy before implementation. 
Andrew Kluis of Communities United Against Police Brutality the issue of transparency is by far the biggest takeaway from the hearing. 
“I can understand why we can’t hear details about the specific cases, but why can’t we hear details about what they think would be good bylaws?” he said. “When the policy committees are discussing what policies they look at, how about having that open to the community, even just to listen, so we can maybe send them an email later saying, ‘Hey this is a policy we should look at,’ but it’s just a total black box of no transparency in government.”

Minneapolis Sen. Scott Dibble didn’t get all that he wanted in legislation to change how the Met Council manages light rail construction projects. The chair of the Senate Transportation Committee had wanted to turn over planning and construction of future projects to the state Department of Transportation.
But the DFL lawmaker and critic of the structure of the regional government did insert requirements into transportation budget language to require MnDOT to provide more-extensive consulting on future projects like the Blue Line extension from Target Center to Brooklyn Park as well as highway bus rapid transit.
The same legislation restricts how the Met Council can spend money from a seven-county transportation sales tax adopted last year. The bill says that before the council can spend any of that money on light rail construction, it would need to receive legislative approval.
 


 


“It’s not an outright takeover of construction of light rail and heavy BRT but I think it is a very meaningful authority that MnDOT would have, being involved every step of the way from the very beginning,” Dibble said. “It would make sure that professional expertise, culture of accountability, responsiveness, innovation, everything we are looking for would be strongly present, with some real teeth in it.”
“Ideally, we won’t have the same experiences we have had in the past,” Dibble said.
Related | Plans to change Met Council governance on hold
The bill would require the involvement of MnDOT in the early risk assessments and cost projections of new projects, the contractor bidding process, review of change orders in excess of $500,000 and schedule delays of more than 30 days. The state agency would also be party to any dispute resolutions, such as what went on between the Met Council and its contractors on Southwest Light Rail Transit that led to a revised budget and timeline.
It would also direct MnDOT to make “recommendations to address or manage cost overruns or discrepancies, funding sources, contingency funding sources and availability, and the management of state or county financial resources.” Finally, it requires Met Council to reimburse MnDOT for any costs it runs up due to the new duties it received under the law.
 


 


Unlike Dibble’s 
previous bill language
 that would have taken the Met Council out of future light rail projects, the commissioner of the MnDOT is OK with the new version.

Commissioner Nancy Daubenberger
“Yes, I was supportive of the language in the final bill and very appreciative of Senator Dibble’s efforts to work with the department to leverage additional MnDOT expertise to meet his goals of providing more accountability and oversight on the Blue Line Extension and potential, future Light Rail Transit projects,” said Commissioner Nancy Daubenberger in statement released to MinnPost.
She had testified against Dibble’s plan to put MnDOT in charge of the Blue Line extension and any other light rail projects such as the Riverview Corridor between downtown St. Paul and MSP airport. Daubenberger cited MnDOT’s already full plate and the increased staff levels that would be needed to take over regional light rail projects. 
Terri Dresen, the director of communications for the Met Council, said the council supports the language.
 


 


“As part of our commitment of building and maintaining trust while working on some of the state’s most complex transportation projects, it’s important we continually collaborate with our partners to provide expertise where appropriate,” Dresen wrote. “The Met Council and MnDOT have a long history of collaboration and expertise and this language provides additional responsibilities and formalizes the existing partnership. It’s a value we support.”
MnDOT has in the recent past been involved in reviewing SWLRT, at the invitation of the Met Council. In December of 2022, it 
released a review
 of the settlement between the council and the project’s civil engineering contractor, Lunda/McCrossan Joint Venture.  
The new bill language, part of a 1,430-page mega omnibus bill approved in the waning minutes of the 2024 legislative session Sunday night, would not apply to the project that has attracted most of the criticism of the council. The Southwest Light Rail Transit project, because it is already under construction, would not be subject to the new requirements.
Gov. Tim Walz indicated Monday that he would sign the bill that contained nine different significant policy bills and omnibus bills, each of which contain dozens of spending and policy bills.
 


 


Dibble and House Transportation Committee Chair Frank Hornstein have both been critical not only of the Met Council’s management of SWLRT but of the culture and governance of the council itself. A task force the two chairs convened to look at whether the seven-county organization should be governed by elected rather than appointed commissioners ended in a stalemate earlier this year. Dibble introduced a bill last year to transfer light rail construction to MnDOT. But he said earlier in the session his motivation for pushing the issue again stems from the failure of the task force and his belief that the Met Council worked against a resolution.
 


 


The Dibble bill to have MnDOT plan and construct light rail — as it did with the original Twin Cities LRT, the Hiawatha Line between downtown Minneapolis and the Mall of America — echoed statements made by Judy Randall, the state’s legislative auditor.
“The council and the state have other light rail transit projects coming up, that are being discussed, that are being vetted,” Randall said last June 
after presenting
 one of three audits conducted by the Office of Legislative Auditor. “Now is the time to think hard about who should be the responsible party for those projects.

“Based on what we’ve seen and based on the structure that we have for funding and building, I’m not convinced that Met Council is the right entity to be the responsible authority for those projects,” Randall said. 
 


 


On Tuesday, Randall said the adopted language is somewhat responsive to several OLA recommendations.
“Yes, we believe that some of the new language is responsive to recommendations OLA has made, notably some of the recommendations in our 
March report,
 Southwest Light Rail Transit Construction:  Metropolitan Council Decision Making,” Randall wrote. One example is bill language requiring MnDOT to provide what are called peer reviews and value engineering reviews at various stages of the project.
Randall said provisions that require reports to the two legislative transportation committees should increase transparency for the project and the council. One report would come from MnDOT and include all recommendations it makes to the council. The second, after requiring that Met Council give “strong consideration to utilize input or recommendations developed by the commissioner of transportation,” said the council must first try to reconcile differences of opinion and then report to the Legislature if it decides not to follow MnDOT advice.

One sentence in the bill also clarifies how the Met Council uses local transportation taxes for light rail and highway BRT projects. It states that the council “must only use direct appropriations in law or federal sources to pay its portion of light rail transit construction. Dibble said that will require that if the council wants to use some of the proceeds from a 0.75% sales tax (75 cents on each $100 purchase) collected in the seven-county metro area, it must get permission from the Legislature.
Dibble said there are two significant sales taxes that pay for transit and transportation in the Twin Cities. One is a county-by-county sales tax of up to 0.50% that can be used for transportation projects. That tax raises about $170 million a year for Hennepin County and is a major contributor to the funds Hennepin County is using to match federal dollars for 
SWLRT
 and the 
Blue Line extension
.
The second tax source is 
last year’s 0.75% tax
 that is collected regionwide by the Met Council that will raise about $500 million a year. Dibble said that money, the first dedicated funds for transit, were first meant to cover a looming deficit in the cost of running the regular bus service by Metro Transit as well as to build out its planned arterial bus rapid transit system. Other proceeds were to cover operating and capital maintenance of light rail and highway BRT lines.
If the Met Council needs additional funds to cover construction cost shortfall for light rail or BRT, it could do so but only after winning approval from the Legislature. That, Dibble said, was always the intent. But the bill language adopted Sunday night makes it clear.

A little more than a month ago as Minneapolis looked at a possible future without Lyft and Uber, around 10 alternative rideshare companies announced plans to launch in Minnesota. 
Some looked to launch a completely new rideshare app, while other established apps looked to make the Twin Cities their next market. But, since these announcements were made, only two new companies – MyWeels and Wridz – have been licensed and started giving rides, at least in Minneapolis. 
More companies and one co-op could still come online eventually, but what sets these early players apart from the others? 
 


 


For one, both companies are quite different from each other. 
MyWeels
 is a new startup launched by a Minnesota businessman and 
Wridz 
is an already established Austin Texas-based app that operates in 22 regions across the country. 
A lot can be learned from the early new players, so here’s a look at the first two: 
MyWeels
One barrier of entry into this market is capital. Money is a challenge for any startup, but operating as a rideshare company in the Twin Cities metro comes with its own specific expenses, said MyWeels founder Elam Baer. 
New rideshare companies entering the Twin Cities need to spend around $300,000 to get off the ground, the business owner estimated, basing his calculation off of his own expenses while launching his new business.  
 


 


There are three jurisdictions companies need to attain a license from: Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the Metropolitan Airport. Combined, these three licences cost about $100,000 in total, Baer said. But there’s a larger expense many people don’t think about, he noted: insurance. Insurance can run upwards of $150,000 per year. 
And these are all annual expenses.  
“Every year, everybody’s going to have to pony up another quarter million dollars,” Baer said.

Baer has calculated that this means rideshare companies need to give a total of about 100,000 rides per year just to afford expenses. This means providing about 500 rides a day, a number the business owner says is attainable. 
 


 


Finding the right staffing balance is also a challenge. Baer is trying to avoid having too many or too few drivers as the business scales.
Elam Baer
“We don’t want to have too many riders and have them go out on the road and not get any rides from us,” he said. “In the same token, we don’t want to have customers downloading the app and requesting a ride and not having a car available.”
Currently, MyWeels has about 50 drivers out on the road at any given time and is planning to increase that to 100. A timeline on expansion is dependent on when St. Paul and the Metropolitan Airport approve licenses for the company. Baer says MyWeels has already started giving rides in Minneapolis. 
As a longtime business owner, Baer got his starting capital from a small group of investors he is part of. The group owns a range of companies including a company that sells gigantic woodcutting saws and an egg processing plant that breaks eggs and converts them into liquid that is then shipped out in tanker loads. Baer also owns a small private equity firm, North Central Equity. 
 


 


While the business of rideshare is new to Baer, he said he’s been using rideshare since Uber came to town. 
“When Uber and Lyft said they were leaving, I – kind of on a personal level – just said, ‘How am I going to get around? Then very quickly it evolved into, ‘Is there a business opportunity here?’ and I jumped on it,” Baer said.

Two paths: A look at Uber and Lyft’s threat to leave Minnesota
Some legislators have claimed
 Uber and Lyft’s threat to leave the state is a bluff
. Baer says whether or not the companies stay in the state, MyWeels will continue to operate. 
 


 


Notably, all of the drivers MyWeels currently has also work for Uber and/or Lyft. This is also the case for the second new rideshare company to enter the market within the last week: Wridz.
 


 


Wridz
Wridz, an already established Austin-based rideshare company, launched Tuesday in Minneapolis and has already completed multiple rides. The company is also waiting on a license in St. Paul and at the airport. 
Operating in 22 markets, Wridz has thousands of drivers, said co-founder and CEO Steve Wright at a news conference Tuesday. But, unlike MyWeels, Wridz is not looking to hit a particular quota of drivers. 
The reason this driver number is less of a concern to Wright comes down to his company’s business model, which is subscription-based, setting the company apart from companies like Uber and Lyft. Wridz drivers pay a $100 a month subscription fee to drive, but are able to keep 100% of their fares. 
“I don’t really track that (number of drivers),” Wright said. “I know a lot of people talk about their numbers and (say), ‘well we got this many drivers this many trips.’”
Because the use of the Wridz app is up to the driver, Wright explained that numbers and density of drivers are less of a concern. For example, Wridz is in a very small market in South Dakota. 
“If there are 10 drivers there and they’re actually using our app successfully and making more money, to me, that’s a success,” he said. “So we don’t get hung up on how many tens of thousands of drivers we have.” 
When asked what happens if too much competition is introduced to the Twin Cities market, Wright reflected on what happened in Austin, Wridz founding city and another city Uber and Lyft threatened, and ultimately did (though only for a year), pull out of.
“When this happened in Austin in 2017 – we weren’t even in the business yet – 10 companies came into play, and they all did very well,” Wright said. 
Every company had a slightly different model and pricing structure. 
“I think that competition is good,” he said. “I think that gives the consumer an option to decide what they want because right now you really don’t have an option. You have brand one and brand two, which are almost identical.”
What comes next? 
The state rideshare bill has not yet been passed and the
 Legislature is in its last week of session. 
Gov. Tim Walz and many legislative leaders have been trying to reach a compromise that will raise driver wages while keeping Uber and Lyft in the state and in Minneapolis. The compromise rates agreed to between legislative negotiators and Minneapolis city council members don’t do that, assuming the two companies aren’t bluffing. 
The possible departure of Uber and Lyft remains July 1, the day the Minneapolis ordinance is supposed to go into effect.

An e-bike is just what Amy Blumenshine needed to continue bicycling as she ages. 
“I’ve been a bicyclist for 60-plus years. And here I am with a maturing body and in an urban setting where it’s really great to have a dependable mode of transportation,” she said, adding she can now take on a headwind, steep hill or long trip with confidence. 
“I don’t have to fret. I don’t have any anxiety about being able to bike where I need to go,” Blumenshine said as she walked her e-bike alongside a crowd of demonstrators at an International Workers’ Day rally earlier this month in south Minneapolis. 
 


 


Blumenshine is among thousands of Minnesotans who have purchased an e-bike in recent years. And as the state prepares to dole out $2 million in rebates for those who purchase e-bikes this summer, the e-bike owner ranks will likely climb even more. 
While more e-bikes could help cut down transportation emissions, the trend is also challenging cities and transit agencies to figure out how to improve bike parking, bike bus racks and more. 
Transporting e-bikes
Most transit agencies in Minnesota are able to handle bicycles, either on a front-mounted rack, on board a bus or train, or both. Some agencies using smaller vehicles, such as Rolling Hills Transit, which serves rural Dodge, Winona, Olmsted, Fillmore, and Houston Counties in southern Minnesota, allows people to bring their bike on board. 
But Bill Spitzer, transportation director at Rolling Hills Transit, says the process of bringing a bike onboard their buses is cumbersome because they would have to use a lift, which could add 10 minutes to a pick-up every time they use it. “Less than ideal and very time consuming,” Spitzer said in an email. 
 


 


Rolling Hills Transit had one bike rack that was destroyed in an accident. The agency has not been able to afford the cost of replacement, which ranges anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 plus the cost to modify a bus. But Spitzer sees the benefits. “A bike rack would not require that additional time spent on a pick up/drop off. At the end of the day a bike rack would greatly improve our ability to service bike riders,” Spitzer said. 
Meanwhile, many of the state’s larger agencies, including Metro Transit, have bike racks mounted on the front of the bus that can handle up to two bicycles. On Metro Transit buses, 
each
 slot can handle a bike that weighs up to 55 pounds, as well as tires around two inches in width.

But not all e-bikes may fit on those racks, either because they are too heavy or their tires are too wide. Sophie Nikitas, an Uptown resident who brings her e-bike on the Route 94 express bus on some mornings when she commutes to work in downtown St. Paul, had issues with taking them off of those racks. “I was, like, really struggling to get my bike out of the rack because it just, like, gets kind of stuck in there,” Nikitas said.

 rapid bus lines, follows a pilot project on two buses over the past year. Metro Transit’s racks, manufactured by Washington-based Sportworks, cost around $1,200 and can handle two bikes up to 78 pounds each, as well as tires around five inches wide. 
 


 


But Metro Transit isn’t sure the demand will be there. They don’t have a way to count the bikes they transport, 
though they tried in the past
. (Duluth Transit, on the other hand, tallied 24,263 bicycles last year using their farebox.) They are also skeptical that the racks are compatible with bikes that require skinnier tires. 
“When they’re sitting deeper, depending on the size of the tire, they may not have the same tension from the hook that goes over the front wheel,” Metro Transit Chief Operating Officer Brian Funk said. “We wanted to try to make sure that we were rolling this out smartly, trying to ensure we weren’t introducing something that we think, you know, would have solved a challenge for one user group but created problems, in this case, for more of the primary users.”
Sophie Nikitas, an Uptown resident who brings her e-bike on the Route 94 express bus on some mornings when she commutes to work in downtown St. Paul, had issues with taking them off of those racks.

Meanwhile, Metro Transit acknowledges that not everyone is able to lift a bike up onto a rack. They are not considering installing racks inside buses because of a 
failed experiment
 involving now-retired buses that ran on the METRO Red Line, a rapid bus route connecting Mall of America to Apple Valley on Cedar Avenue. “It ended up taking up a significant space on a pretty narrow vehicle compared to a train — ended up with the people who are brushing up against it and damaging clothing and things like that,” Funk said. 
Instead, Metro Transit is exploring options for its own covered bike parking pilot that would also replace existing 
bike storage boxes
, which can be rented for up to a year. The hope is the new storage would have features that will allow e-bike users to leave their bike to charge and retrieve it later. 
 


 


Secure storage
Meanwhile, both Metro Transit and the city of Minneapolis have uncovered bike parking options, which can be as simple as a short metal post with a giant ring towards the top. 
For Nikitas, locking her bike outdoors makes her feel anxious. To make herself feel better, she has security measures in place for her bike. “I added an AirTag. And then there’s also this frame lock that it came with. I have this giant, like, very beefy chain lock that I use. Even if someone cuts through my chain lock, somehow cuts through the frame lock, I can at least track them at least until they realize that the AirTag is on it,” Nikitas said.

But as Metro Transit considers its best covered bike storage option, the city of Minneapolis hopes to deploy this summer a covered bicycle parking pilot that could allow for more secure storage, as well as e-bike charging. They are working with the only company that responded to the city’s requests for proposals, Brooklyn-based Black-owned covered bike parking firm Oonee, to deploy between 15 and 20 covered bike parking facilities throughout the city. The racks, 
which would be their first outside of the New York City area,
 would be free to use, supported by ads, available to use year-round for 
at least the next three years
, and accessible by smartphone or a key fob. 
The cost incurred by the city so far appears to be the time Minneapolis’ mobility planner Russ Brooks spent in developing the pilot. Brooks said in a phone interview that the city has not identified where the bike storage facilities will be. “We want to go through a collaborative process with our partner agencies, with communities, with local businesses and others around where is the best place that we can put these,” said Brooks, adding they plan to consider where bike thefts have occurred, where they have available space, if a site has power access, and where they may have potential demand, which includes access to high-frequency transit.
 


 


The city may run into challenges in siting the facilities on Metro Transit property and Minneapolis parkland. Metro Transit already has an advertising contract, and 
state law restricts how money generated on property funded by bonds can be used
. Additionally, the Minneapolis Park Board 
prohibits advertising on parkland
. 
While the facilities can be deployed without ads, Brooks says they might not deploy them to parkland this time around. “The network needs to be a net positive,” Brooks said, adding they are more interested in ensuring the lockers are sited in disadvantaged communities, which could include parkland.
Meanwhile, 
Minneapolis
, 
Minnetonka
, 
Hopkins
, 
Eden Prairie
, 
Rochester
, and 
Shakopee
 have retooled their zoning codes to require covered bike parking in developments that result from new construction — and in some cities, expansions to existing construction — so long as it meets certain conditions, such as the amount of units proposed to be built, if a developer is being required to provide more than 20 bicycle parking spaces, and if the developer intends to provide covered car parking. However, only 
Minneapolis
 and 
Richfield
 require bike parking rooms to have electricity, which could be used by someone to charge their bike. 
None of the cities appear to require sprinklers in bike rooms. The state building code requires sprinklers in dwelling units, 
except for garages and unheated entry areas
 adjacent to an exit door. San Francisco made 
changes to their fire code in March
 responding to a 
spate of fires caused by faulty e-bike batteries
.
Choosing an e-bike
The Minnesota Department of Revenue, which is implementing the statewide e-bike rebate, plans to accept 
requests for rebate certificates next month
. The $2 million in certificates they plan to issue in July, each worth up to $1,500 depending on the value of the bike and the income of the requestor, are good for two months and can only be redeemed on e-bikes that they have not yet purchased. Redeemers will also only be able to purchase e-bikes with batteries that meet industry safety certifications. 
Clark Andreasen, who got an e-bike when he was living in the eastside of St. Paul because he wanted to get around without a car, recommended getting a bike that is UL-listed. “Especially if you’re going to charge it unattended,” said Andreasen. “That is kind of some good peace of mind that it’s not going to burn down my apartment building.” 
Nikitas, who used to work at a bike shop, recommends going to a local bike shop to determine the best bike to purchase. “Just ride a lot of bikes and see what feels good to you. Don’t just get something that has, like, the coolest features or, like, looks the nicest,” she said. “At the end of the day, you just want something that’s really fun and comfortable to ride.” 
Dominic Playle agrees, after encountering challenges with getting his e-bike maintained. “They won’t touch the electronics on it because they’re not the licensed dealer. I would definitely recommend going to a local licensed bike shop and buying something with a warranty that they are willing to work on,” Playle said. 
Meanwhile, Blumenshine, the senior cyclist featured earlier in the story, cautions prospective users not to underestimate the power of an e-bike. “It’s important not to be cocky,” she said.

It isn’t often that legislators call out of a member of their own party, especially by name.  While criticizing the other party is a daily occurrence — hourly even — intraparty attacks are usually reserved for closed-door caucus meetings and after-hours cocktail talk.
When it happens like it did on Tuesday, then, it’s an event. Rep. Mike Howard directly and Sen. Lindsey Port indirectly blamed fellow DFL lawmaker Ron Latz for playing hardball to kill a provision in a massive omnibus bill. The section said that landlords and building managers couldn’t reject tenants solely because they would pay rent with housing vouchers — primarily the federal Section 8 vouchers. They could also not place in advertisements that they didn’t accept vouchers.
Failure to rent to such prospective tenants would subject the landlord to charges of engaging in “unfair discriminatory practice.” Minneapolis has had 
a similar provision
 since 2017. According to Howard, Latz said he would vote against the bill that contains much of the session’s work on transportation, labor and housing if the “source of income” discrimination language remained.

“I think it is important for the public to know that the reason this bill is not moving forward is the Senate Judiciary Chair, Sen. Latz, has informed us that he would vote against this entire transportation, housing and labor bill if this provision is in our bill,” said Howard, a DFLer from Richfield, during a Tuesday evening meeting of a House-Senate conference committee crafting an agreement on those three subject areas. 
State Rep. Mike Howard
“That is beyond disappointing that one member of this Legislature would seek to take down all of the fine work of all of the members, all of the Minnesotans who have done work in housing and labor and transportation in this bill,” Howard said. “But we can’t in good conscience put all of that work at risk.”
“Near the end of session, bills and priorities, sometimes they die. Every legislator in this body, it’s their prerogative to decide how they’re going to vote on an issue,” Howard said. “But I think it is also the public’s prerogative to understand why something so important like basic rights for low-income renters is not moving forward.”
Port said the provision was needed because one quarter of those who are able to get the in-short-supply vouchers can’t find someone to accept the voucher.
 


 


“Source-of-income protection, which 20 states have already adopted, will help to assure that every step we take to support families in exiting homelessness is used more effectively and helps us move closer to permanently ending family homelessness in Minnesota,” the Burnsville DFLer said.
State Sen. Lindsey Port
“Unfortunately, the Senate does not have the votes to pass this provision and protect against discrimination,” she said. “I will not hide my disappointment in that fact, Mr. Chair.”
Port then moved the amendment to remove the section which was adopted on a voice vote.
 


 


Latz, who is not a member of the conference committee, said Tuesday evening that he has a history of supporting affordable housing, both as a member of the Legislature and formerly as a member of the St. Louis Park City Council. But he said he has a philosophical disagreement with mandating that landlords take part in federal and state housing voucher programs.
 


 


He said his position is well known and that the provision was not in the Senate housing bill for that reason.
“I don’t think it would be right to require a property owner, as a condition of making their units available for lease, to sign a federal contract and subject themselves to federal regulation and contractual requirements, additional inspections and a substantial administrative burden under penalty of being accused of discrimination,” Latz said in an interview.
The federal Section 8 housing program was never intended to be mandatory and it is not on the federal level, he said, adding that he is a supporter of affordable housing and voucher programs, including the state’s Bring it Home rental assistance program.
Latz said a better approach would be to offer incentives to landlords to accept vouchers, as other states and cities have done, including signing bonuses and tax incentives. He also said the Federal Housing Administration needs to make the program more efficient.
 


 


“It’s a complex problem,” Latz said. “I’m a full supporter of affordable housing. It’s just that this particular program is problematic. It’s trying to turn landlords into federal contractors against their will and then accusing them of discrimination if they don’t agree to do it.”The provision to require property managers to accept housing vouchers is the latest 
housing-related proposal to fall away
 during this year’s legislative session. Other provisions that won’t pass this year include the so-called 
missing middle housing bill
 to encourage duplexes, triplexes and four-plexes and a multifamily housing bill that would have required cities to approve most multifamily projects in commercial zones. An effort to limit how a state environmental law is used to 
challenge housing density plans
, including the Minneapolis 2040 plan, is still alive.

This week, state legislators found themselves in a familiar position. Once again, lawmakers have proposed rideshare minimum wage legislation that has prompted Uber and Lyft to threaten to leave. Only a month ago, the companies were on the brink of fulfilling a threat to leave Minneapolis (or the entire seven-county metro in Uber’s case) after the city council passed its own rideshare ordinance. Now, the companies are threatening to leave the entire state – again.  
With the legislative session coming to an end soon, the clock is ticking. There are some major moves that could still come in the next two weeks. Here’s a look at what scenarios could lead to Uber and Lyft’s departure, and what would entice the companies to stay:
The scenario where Uber and Lyft leave 
The crux of the issue comes down to driver compensation rates. State leaders are proposing a minimum $1.27 per mile and 49 cents per minute rate with a $5 minimum ride requirement. If this rate passes, Minneapolis City Council members have agreed to reduce their ordinance’s per mile-rate by 13 cents to match the state’s rate. 
 


 


This rate was reached as a compromise in negotiations between city and state lawmakers. But these negotiations did not include Uber and Lyft. The companies say this rate is still too high and will raise ride rates above what many riders are willing to pay, hurting drivers and riders alike.

First things first: Minnesota care providers seek funding for their own mental health
 






 


If the state keeps the rate as it is currently proposed, the companies say they will leave. Even if the rate is lowered to a compromise Uber and Lyft agree to, a question remains over what will happen in Minneapolis. 
And that’s where one more catch comes into play. It’s pretty clear many lawmakers do not want to worry about city governments setting rates that could prompt these companies to threaten to leave major metro areas now or in the future. 
House Majority Leader Jamie Long, DFL-Minneapolis, one of lead negotiators working with the state House, Senate and governor on a rideshare bill,
 has said he wants to avoid preemption
. However, 
GOP legislators have attempted to add legislation that would restrict lower governments’ ability to set their own minimums on rideshare rates. 
 


 


If Minneapolis forges forward with its ordinance’s current proposed rates, Uber and Lyft say they will pull out by July 1. 
The scenario where Uber and Lyft stay
Long has also said he believes 
Uber and Lyft are bluffing 
and will not actually pull out of Minnesota. 
However, assuming that the companies are not bluffing, Lyft has, though begrudgingly, 
said it would agree to a wage increase to 89 cents per minute and 49 cents per mile.
 This was the lowest rate suggested in a 
state study released
 in March, one day after Minneapolis passed its own rideshare ordinance that would mandate $1.40 per hour and 61 cents per minute, a number based off of 2019 Seattle rideshare drivers earnings.
 


 


Uber seems to be looking for a far lower rate. During a Tuesday hearing for the bill in the House Labor and Industry Finance Committee, Joel Carlson, a Minnesota lobbyist working for Uber, said Uber wants 41 cents per mile and 61 cents per minute.
 


 


So, in order for at least one of the companies to stop threatening to leave the state, it seems that legislation would have to require no more than 89 cents per mile. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Tim Walz also hasn’t shown approval for this week’s proposed legislation. The governor said he will remain committed to raising wages for drivers while still ensuring Uber and Lyft do not leave the state. 
He hasn’t indicated what he might do if the current rideshare bill passes. However, he has already vetoed a rideshare bill once before.
 He blocked a similar bill last year,
 stating the measure “could make Minnesota one of the most expensive states in the country for rideshare” and that “increased rideshare rates will limit, and potentially eliminate, needed transportation options for vulnerable communities.”
After vetoing the 2023 bill, the 
governor put together a work group to help lawmakers craft a new bill to support higher pay for workers. 
 


 


So if rideshare minimum rates don’t pass 89 cents per mile or a higher rate bill is vetoed, then at least Lyft would likely stay. 
However, that doesn’t account for the city of Minneapolis. Unless the Legislature passes a compromise suitable to a majority of the Minneapolis City Council or votes to preempt the council from legislating over rates, the council may forge forward with its ordinance exceeding rates Uber and Lyft find acceptable. Then the company’s threat will go back to the city level. 
If this happens, Uber and Lyft might stay if the city also lowers its rates outlined in its ordinance. Or maybe Long is right and the companies are bluffing. If the companies ultimately do pull out, 
officials are looking to new local alternatives to fill the gap.

Legislation that would end the lawsuit against the Minneapolis 2040 comprehensive plan got new life this week.
That doesn’t mean the proposal meant to protect comp plans that calls for increased housing density in cities and suburbs won’t die during the last 10 days of the 2024 legislative session.
The so-called “Comp Plan Clarity” bill, now contained in a massive state and local government omnibus bill, is just one of many remaining issues caught up in the turmoil in the state Senate triggered by the April 22 arrest of Sen. Nicole Mitchell and the subsequent first-degree burglary charge.
 


 


In order to move the issue forward, backers need the Senate to act on its version of the state and local government bill. That would push the spending and policy bill into a conference committee. No omnibus bill, however, no Comp Plan Clarity. Sen. Lindsey Port, the Burnsville DFLer who is chair of the Senate Housing Committee, said that bill “is still up in the air over here.”
State Sen. Lindsey Port
The session adjourns May 20.
The House did what supporters of the issue needed done on Monday night. They succeeded in amending the bill to exempt the already adopted Minneapolis and St. Paul comprehensive plans from the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act (MERA). That’s the state’s fundamental environmental protection law that was used by opponents of the Minneapolis plan to challenge the plan — so-far successfully — and keep it from being implemented.
The amendment also exempts all future comprehensive plans from environmental review under another law, the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act.

The immediate effect would be to end the lawsuit brought by a group called Smart Growth Minneapolis. It would also prevent similar MERA-based lawsuits against future plans but still require comp plans to meet environmental policy law. Backers of the bills, both city organizations and environmental groups, say while the plans themselves wouldn’t require environmental review, any construction projects allowed by the plans would need to show what harms they would produce and how they might be mitigated.
RELATED: 
Are environmental laws being used against the environment? Why lawmakers want to end a lawsuit against the Minneapolis 2040 plan.
Comp plans are required in the Twin Cities region every 10 years to show how cities will accommodate the population growth that the Met Council estimates will occur. They are planning documents that drive planning and zoning decisions. While the Minneapolis and St. Paul plans call for increased housing density, housing and environmental advocates say many cities use the plans to discourage growth. The bill language not only protects the two cities’ plans, it would relieve some uncertainty about litigation risks for cities in the midst of their comp plan process, backers say.
Minneapolis received 
nationwide attention
 for the way its plan pushed for increased density as a way of concentrating population growth in areas already served by infrastructure, including transit. Single-family neighborhoods should accommodate “missing middle” housing such as duplexes, the plan stated. And multifamily housing would be directed to corridors close to transit lines. Parking minimums were cut, and zoning changes were made in many areas to allow more development.
 


 


The suit, filed by a group called 
Smart Growth Minneapolis
, argued that under state environmental law the city was required to conduct an environmental review. Because the plan was designed to accommodate more than 100,000 new residents over the 10-year planning period, the city should study the impacts on the environment of such growth. Smart Growth’s suit asserted population growth could degrade the environment by increasing the amount of paved surfaces that could increase the impact of stormwater runoff, by increasing the number of people straining wastewater systems, by reducing tree canopy and by increasing air pollution.
 


 


Courts, including the state Supreme Court, agreed that MERA did not exempt comp plans from the need for environmental review and the rights of citizens to file suit demanding such a review. Sponsors of the original bill said they felt the Supreme Court invited them clarify legislative intent on comp plans and MERA. In his ruling in 
Smart Growth v. Minneapolis
, Justice Gordon Moore noted two other laws that exempt certain actions from MERA — one in the Waste Management Act and again regarding the Minnesota Agriculture and Economic Development Board.
“… the Legislature has shown on at least two occasions that it knows how to expressly exempt statutes from the scope of MERA when it desires to do so,” Moore wrote.
Environmental groups, as well as social justice organizations supporting increased housing opportunities, opposed the use of the state’s fundamental environmental protection law against a comp plan they say protects the environment. That is, a plan that increases housing density in urban areas combats suburban and rural sprawl and makes transit use more feasible.
 


 


State Rep. Mike Howard
A relatively brief exchange during the lengthy debate on the 
state and local government omnibus bill
 displayed the political differences over the proposal.
Rep. Mike Howard, DFL-Richfield, supported the changes.
“With this language and the underlying language we’ve worked very closely with our environmental groups, and they support this language,” Howard said. The amendments passed on a voice vote.
But Rep. Peggy Scott, R-Andover, moved to jettison the entire section of the now-amended bill, arguing that it was an attempt by the city to do what the courts wouldn’t — dismiss the Smart Growth challenge.
 


 


“We’re going to go around the court decision, we’re going to go around what our constitution wants and we’re going to change the law ourselves,” Scott said. “But we don’t exist to go around the court for special interests. It’s not why we’re here.”
Scott portrayed the lawsuit as the residents of the city rising up against the government.
State Rep. Peggy Scott
Howard pushed back.
“There are a few loud folks who did bring a lawsuit,” he said and urged lawmakers to contact their mayors and city councils about the bill language adopted Monday.
“Comp plans are an idea, a vision for what they want their city to look like,” Howard said. “When a project is proposed, that’s when full environmental review is appropriate.”
Scott’s amendment failed on a voice vote. The comp plan clarity language is all that remains of a 
trio of bills
 meant to promote more density in urban and suburban cities. The motivation is to direct more housing growth to already developed areas to combat sprawl and to reduce the cost and increase the availability of housing. But two other measures are considered dead for 2024 — a bill requiring so-called missing middle housing types such as duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in single-family zones and a proposal to require cities to permit multifamily buildings in commercial zones.

Climate change misinformation is on the rise as climate education remains sporadic in school curriculum across the country, according to recently released research from a nonprofit that tracks digital information.  
Though Minnesota is among the most robust states in the nation in requiring climate education in its academic standards, advocates say more can be done by school districts to weave the guidelines into their curriculums, and by lawmakers to update the guidelines further. 
According to the 
Center on Countering Digital Hate’s report,
 the last five years have seen climate change misinformation evolve from outright denial to attacks on climate scientists and attempts to undermine solutions to the worsening climate. Meanwhile, the 
North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) found
 that educators want to teach climate education but don’t have the resources. 
 


 


After surveying more than 700 educators and 100 administrators, NAAEE found that climate education is sporadic, with school districts not making the subject a priority. Despite willingness from educators, school districts nationwide fail to provide resources or a clear mandate to implement a formal climate curriculum.

Danielle Hefferan, Minnesota-based Climate Generation’s regional education coordinator, said the NAAEE study found that Minnesota is among states like California and Oregon as leaders in climate education. Not all states require climate change in their academic standards, but many that do only require the topic be taught in science. In contrast, climate education requirements show up across multiple subjects in Minnesota like social studies and language arts, she said. 
Minnesota formally adopted climate change into its science education standards in 2019 after the Minnesota Department of Education put together a 26-member task force of educators and community members to develop the updated guidelines. 
Hefferan said Minnesota also has a high number of local governments with plans to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which helps educators teach the subject to students in those communities.
 


 


“Minnesota definitely, on paper, has a lot of things going for it in terms of more policies and things that support climate change education,” she said. “And educators’ confidence increases quite a bit when they know their district and their state, whether through their policies or laws, support climate change education.”
But there still remain some growing pains.

While there are a lot of resources and lesson plans around climate change education that are accessible to teachers, Hefferan said that if a district hasn’t yet created a formal climate curriculum, it falls on the teachers — who are already strained for time — to figure out how to incorporate the subject. Uniformity in curriculum planning could help fix the issue, she said. 
 


 


“We see that resources are available but for some reason, there’s still some sort of glitch in weaving them in,” she said. “Being able to help weave in those resources into the formal curriculums that teachers are providing each year would be really helpful.”
 


 


Though Minnesota is a leader nationwide in climate education, Climate Generation is working to expand those guidelines further. 
House File 2297 would require school districts and charter schools across Minnesota to add climate justice education to their curriculums. That would include not just educating students about the effects of climate change but also about inequities caused by it and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. 
“The disadvantaged among us get the brunt of it, and in many cases it’s the folks that have caused it the least that are experiencing the biggest impacts of it,” said DFL Rep. Larry Kraft of St. Louis Park, who is carrying the bill in the House. “That’s the justice aspect of it.”
Kraft was aware of the effort before becoming a lawmaker, so when the bill was brought to him by the youth environmental activists with Climate Generation he agreed to carry it. Kraft, who before ran a nonprofit for five years that helped young people advocate for climate policy, said education is an important piece in developing solutions to the issue.
 


 


“As you can see from the non-winter we just had, as well as the horrific air quality of last summer caused by the Canadian wildfires which are definitely exacerbated by climate change, we are living it,” he said. “Understanding what’s happening is important. You need to understand so that you can address it.”
Kraft said the bill won’t advance this session, partly due to concerns that it may be too soon to impose more requirements on schools after last year’s jam-packed legislative session that featured a large education package. But he said he plans to continue working with youth activists and environmental groups to get the bill passed. 
“On this one, I’ve been following their lead and I’m excited to keep working with them going forward to figure out how we get this or something like this across the finish line,” he said.

The Minneapolis City Council is hoping for an influx of millions of dollars that the city would use to help achieve its climate equity goals after approving applications to two federal grant programs. 
City officials, residents and businesses alike see the availability and potential influx of funding as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to go all-in on the implementation of climate initiatives that have only been discussed for years. 
On April 25, the council approved grant applications to the federal Environmental Protection Agency — one through its Commercial Energy Cost Efficiency cost share program and another that would help to fund home weatherization, energy efficiency and electrification. 
 


 


Both programs would be funded by the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program, a piece of the larger Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022 that allocates $5 billion to states and municipal and tribal governments to figure out and implement ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Commercial Energy Cost Efficiency program consists of a cohort of cities that include Minneapolis, St. Paul, Bloomington, Eagan, Edina, Hopkins, Richfield and St. Louis Park — all cities that have existing programs, which makes it easier for funding to be distributed to small businesses and community members. Should the application be approved, the cities listed would split $10 million, with Minneapolis likely receiving the largest chunk of the funding. 
The residential decarbonization program would grant the city of Minneapolis $10 million to continue the weatherization of homes.

This would be in addition to 
$10 million invested last year into the city’s Climate Legacy Initiative
 — which calls for 100% carbon neutrality by 2050 — and another $8 million given to the city by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for tree removal and replacement. 
 


 


“This was our hope when we created it, that when the mayor and City Council created this funding, we’d be able to create programs that we can use to leverage additional state and federal funding,” said Patrick Hanlon, the city’s deputy commissioner of sustainability. “We’ve created weatherization programs and small business grant programs, and so we’ll be able to take these federal funds and infuse them right into the Climate Legacy Initiative to be able to allow us to serve more people.”
The grant application approvals come nearly a month after city officials put in another application to the EPA for funding from the same grant program. Approved on March 30 by the council, the application asks for funds to continue the city’s Electric Vehicle Spot Network and car sharing programs.

Launched in 2022, the partnership between Minneapolis and St. Paul consists of 70 EV charging stations between the two cities and a fleet of vehicles that can be used by the public. City officials asked for $47 million in their application to add more cars to their fleet and build more charging stations. 
“We feel like we could do a rapid expansion of this program with those funds now,” said Dillion Fried, mobility and curbside manager with the city’s Public Works Department. “And it would help the city achieve a number of our climate and climate equity goals because there’ll be an immediate reduction in the number of car trips that are taken with internal combustion engine vehicles.”
 


 


 


 


Equity program underway 
Last year, the council adopted the Climate Equity Plan, which lays out a decade-long path, with a focus on low-income communities and communities of color, to achieve the city’s climate goals. To help pay for it, the city approved a plan in October to raise utility franchise fees, which is expected to generate about $10 million annually. 
Since then, implementation has been underway. The city has been assisting residents with weatherizing their homes via better insulation, doing zero-cost energy audits for homes and businesses, and operating the Green Cost Share program, which pays for property upgrades to simultaneously help residents and businesses save money and lessen environmental impact. 
Despite current efforts, Hanlon said the scope of the problem in tending to climate change at the local level is often greater than the amount of available funding can address. The infusion of federal funds, in addition to local sources like utility franchise fees, can really help meet the city’s robust goals while also empowering its residents and business owners to take part.
“To be able to leverage these funds helps us get at the bigger greenhouse gas emission targets,” he said. “But it also creates more resources for people in our communities, to be able to overcome their own financial challenges to make these changes in their households or in their small businesses across the city.”
 


 


Matt Kazinka, senior strategic initiatives manager with Lake Street Council, a coalition of businesses along the south Minneapolis corridor, has been helping small businesses explore more ways to save energy since 2015. As of late, he said, he has been impressed in how the city has been ramping up investments toward implementing more robust climate initiatives.
As the city considers which residents and small businesses would benefit most from these programs, Kazinka said the city needs to prioritize business owners and residents who have, in the past, been unaware or explicitly excluded from these types of opportunities. 
“What’s really critical is that we help the businesses who won’t hear about it, who won’t be ready to take advantage of these on their own, and that we invest in the capacity to help those businesses,” he said. “I think that the city is infusing that into their applications for these programs but it needs to be a constant sort of drumbeat for all of us as community members and for the organizations pursuing these funds that this is an opportunity to undo historic imbalances.”

With less than 24 hours notice, hundreds came out to Shiloh Temple International Ministries to honor the memory of Sammy McDowell with a community barbeque and a balloon release. 
The gathering was a testament to McDowell’s spirit, which touched the lives of so many in Minneapolis and beyond. The balloon release was timed for 6:30 p.m. CST so communities in Chicago, Dallas, Arizona, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, North Carolina and Arizona, could release balloons at the same time.
McDowell, the beloved owner of Sammy’s Avenue Eatery at 1101 West Broadway Ave. in Minneapolis died unexpectedly Sunday. He opened the cafe in 2012, which was the subject of an episode of YouTube Series 
Small Business Revolution
 in 2021. His cafe has been a beacon to many looking for a safe gathering place, including in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, when the eatery became a hub and meeting place for community activists. 
 


 


As demand for Sammy’s much loved sandwiches rose, McDowell had been expanding. Just last year, 
he expanded into a space in Golden Thyme in St. Paul’s Rondo neighborhood. 
Looking around at community members gathered at his church Tuesday, Bishop Richard D. Howell, Jr. said McDowell “would love this.” His reach across communities was wide and people and God were his true passion, the pastor said.

“He’d probably be somewhere cooking right now,” Howell said. “He’d probably be cooking hamburgers, something like that, because that’s the kind of person he was. Just to see this community, that’s what he was all about.” 
His impact on the corridor
Ward 5 Council Member Jeremiah Ellison met McDowell long before Ellison served in office. They met when Ellison was in his early 20s when he had an art studio above Juxtaposition Arts. As was the case for so many north Minneapolis and West Broadway area residents, Ellison would head down to Sammy’s Eatery on a regular basis.

“He could have fostered a space where it was get in and get out, right? He didn’t foster that space. He fostered a space where people can hang out, where he was gonna hire youth – Black youth and queer youth,” Ellison said. “Sammy was not going to tell you what to do or how to act, but he was going to provide a safe space for you to experiment and grow and be yourself and mature.” 
Ellison emphasized that McDowell and Sammy’s Avenue Eatery disproved many narratives about what it is like to run a business on the West Broadway corridor.

“I remember when people were saying, ‘Well, businesses can’t come here because we don’t have the workforce, we don’t have a talented enough workforce.’ He was hiring people locally, and then just training them up to the top,” Ellison said. “ I think that, in every way that people described the market failure of the corridor, he went and disproved that – he hired locally, paid well, and trained people.”
DeVon Nolen, market and outreach manager for the West Broadway Farmers Market also spoke about how McDowell embodied the spirit of north Minneapolis business. She first got to know McDowell while working at the West Broadway Business Area Coalition where she later served on the coalition’s board. 
 


 


“Sammy was 10 toes down, that’s what we’d say. Sammy was 10 toes down,” Nolen said. “There’s commerce happening here in north Minneapolis. That’s the story that doesn’t always get told here, about the businesses that we do have that do well because they have a high level of intentionality.”
His employees 
“I met Sammy when I was working for a nonprofit and my contract didn’t get renewed. I was trying to figure out what to do,” Joel Martinez said at the balloon release. 
It was 2014 and Martinez found himself at Sammy’s Avenue Eatery two days in a row. The first day, a new eatery employee never showed up for work. The second day Martinez came in, McDowell was by himself. 
“I opened my laptop and (McDowell) goes, ‘You, register,’ and that was the beginning,” Martinez said with a laugh. 
 


 


 


 


Eight months later, Martinez was still working with McDowell in the early years of Sammy’s Avenue Eatery. Eventually, he helped train new staff, including youth. 
McDowell was known for helping people get “second chance” jobs at the cafe. But he also helped teenagers get their first job experience. Teaching youth often meant going “back to the basics,” Martinez said, like reminding them to wash their hands, teaching basic customer service, and emphasizing the importance of showing up on time to work. 
McDowell also employed Martinez’s mother Bertha Martinez, who, during the balloon release, proudly showed a picture of herself working at Sammy’s Avenue Eatery.

Bertha Martinez had been retired when McDowell asked her to come on part time. Both came from a customer service background. Though Bertha Martinez does not speak much English, she and McDowell understood each other through food. 
 


 


“They just clicked together,” Joel Martinez said of the relationship between his mother and McDowell. 
Sandwiches were Sammy’s vehicle to build community 
After the balloons were released, Robbin Brown walked up to McDowell’s sister, Shaawn-Dai McDowell, and gave her a big hug. The two reminisced about their youth. Brown said McDowell adopted her into his family. Brown worked with Sammy for a time at KFC where McDowell had risen to manager at age 16. 
“We would always get together. We’d always eat. We’d share and we’d always talk about the lord,” said Brown. “He’s definitely going to be missed. This is just a fraction of people who knew him. The funeral is going to be, woh.”
When Sammy McDowell walked into a room, you knew it, said pastor Andre Dukes, assistant pastor at Shiloh Temple International Ministries. He had an attitude of possibility and a big smile. 
“You knew when he came into a room, there was going to be a calm, because that was his presence. Sammy was always calm. He never got angry, visibly. He may have been angry internally, but he always showed a peaceful, calm front. He was always loving and encouraging.” 
But he would challenge people too, Dukes said. He would not be angry or judgemental, but McDowell would challenge people to be better. 
“He would challenge us to really pay attention to what mattered the most and to not get distracted by all of the things that were going on around us, but to really focus on life, focus on love, focus on God,” said Dukes. 
So many of those who knew McDowell said the same thing: He’d give you the shirt off his back. 
“When I first met Sammy, he was singing in the choir,” Dukes reminisced. That was more than 20 years ago. The pastor said McDowell was a phenomenal artist. As he grew, his art became sandwiches, but all throughout, his passion remained in unifying people. 
“And even though he had a passion for making sandwiches, sandwiches were really just a vehicle to build community,” Dukes said.

There’s no question construction of the 13.4-mile Blue Line light rail extension will affect property owners, businesses and renters along the route. But so far, many of them say they want more assurances from Hennepin County and Met Council planners ranging from financial support to more certainty about how the project will affect them.
Planners earlier this month unveiled ideas — but few details — of how they want to help local residents and businesses navigate construction, as a proposed $70 million package from the Legislature to help those affected is still in play.  Yet even with an agenda in place, frustration about the proposal’s construction impacts and how to mitigate them remains, regardless of whether people support the project or not. 
Some advocates who pushed the county and Met Council to develop anti-displacement measures say they had no opportunity to refine those recommendations. They also want more details on how county and Met Council officials plan to implement those recommendations, and how much they plan to spend on it. Meanwhile, other renters and business owners are worried about having their lives disrupted, with or without a plan in place. 
 


 


Hennepin County first discussed the building of a light rail line to serve the northwest suburbs in the late 1980s. In June 2012, the Hennepin County board decided to take the existing Blue Line northwest from Target Field to a 
Target-owned field in Brooklyn Park
, with stops on Olson Memorial Highway in Minneapolis and West Broadway in Brooklyn Park, as well along a railroad corridor in Golden Valley, Robbinsdale, and Crystal. 
The route was contingent on Burlington Northern Santa Fe allowing Hennepin County and the Met Council build a light rail on their corridor; however, BNSF refused to negotiate, so planners from 2020 to 2023 decided to realign the project so it serves the North Loop, 21st Avenue and West Broadway in north Minneapolis on its way to Robbinsdale, Crystal and Brooklyn Park.
Planners anticipate breaking ground on the project 
between 2026 and 2027
, with the route to open for service in 2030. They anticipate ridership reaching anywhere from 11,000 to 13,500 daily riders by 2045, or about the same level of ridership that a shorter streetcar line connecting the Mall of America to downtown St. Paul on 
West 7th
 would generate five years earlier. 
The project is expected to cost $2.9 to $3.2 billion, and the costs include some anti-displacement measures required by federal and state law. “Things like, maintaining access to businesses during construction, right-of-way acquisition, relocation assistance … those are things that we would be doing no matter what,” said project spokesperson Kyle Mianulli at a March corridor management committee meeting. For example, if the project requires the taking of private land, government agencies in most cases must provide compensation and relocation assistance for whomever lives there. This includes paying fair market value for land they acquire as well as expenses that its residents may incur to sell and move. 
 


 


METRO Blue Line Light Rail Transit Extension

 Metropolitan Council
A 
guide from the Met Council
, last updated in April 2023, suggests all U.S. citizen residents, businesses, and nonprofits can be paid “reasonable” expenses or a fixed rate for moving to a place within 50 miles of — and similar to — where they are being displaced from. The Met Council may also provide long-term residents being displaced 
rental
 or 
down payment assistance
, as well as pay the difference between a higher purchase price, rent, or mortgage rate of a home compared to where they used to live.

Federal law also stipulates residents occupying a property that a government agency plans to acquire cannot receive 
relocation assistance
 until the agency either acquires the land, starts negotiations to acquire, or provides a 
written notice
 to the occupants that they plan to acquire. Agencies cannot do this until 
they complete the federally-required environmental review process
, which project planners don’t anticipate happening until next year. 
Federal law also requires agencies to provide residents at least 90 days to move
, and agencies 
cannot force residents to move
 until residents have done their own due diligence. 
Federal law also requires agencies to 
estimate
 how many people and businesses they plan to displace, as well as how much replacement housing and business space would be available. Hennepin County officials say they won’t know until after they complete and release a report mid-June on how the project would affect surrounding noise, traffic, parking, water, air, endangered species, and historic resources. 
The law also requires agencies to 
understand
 what residents and businesses need in a replacement space in order to help them get the assistance they need to move. 
 


 


What displacement support could include
The county, the Met Council, and neighborhood activists have said they want project planners to do more than what is federally required. Yet activists, community organizers, residents and business owners are getting frustrated because the county hasn’t outlined what specifically they plan to do. 
Last May
, the University of Minnesota Center for Urban and Regional Affairs released a list of what government agencies along the Blue Line Extension corridor should do for residents and businesses who would be affected by its construction. These recommendations, which CURA developed with a working group, include keeping renters in place as much as they can, provide funding and wayfinding for local businesses, as well as develop a policy to discharge land they no longer need.
Hennepin County and the Met Council responded to these recommendations, saying 
at an April meeting
 they planned to implement much of what CURA recommended. They include universal basic income, workforce programs, and forgivable loans for businesses to cover basic expenses during construction. 
It’s unclear how much all of this would cost both agencies, or how both would go about doing this. This has some corridor residents, organizers, and business owners upset. “We don’t want to hear any more pretty talking. We want to see actual, actionable steps,” said KB Brown, a native Northsider who owns Wolfpack Promotionals on West Broadway. 
 


 


The 
Blue Line Coalition
, a coalition of transportation, housing, neighborhood, and social service organizations convened by the Alliance Twin Cities, along with the anti-displacement working group, have accused county planners of not working with them to develop a plan to implement the anti-displacement recommendations. 
Each submitted
 letters on April 11 to corridor management committee members demanding the county and Met Council develop steps they plan to achieve to implement each of the recommendations before, during, and after construction, who will work on the steps, how it will be funded, how they plan to evaluate and achieve success, and measures they will take to mitigate any negative impacts. 
 


 


Some members of the anti-displacement working group also want committee members to be paid as much as project consultants for their participation in developing the recommendations, including back pay. The Blue Line Coalition believes all the anti-displacement efforts for the entire corridor would cost around $1 billion.

The anti-displacement working group is also requesting the county relinquish vacant land and buildings along the corridor to “community control,” so businesses can have a place to go before, during, and after construction. “We don’t want to sign a five-year lease and then end up going through a whole bunch of rigmarole to break the lease if the Blue Line comes down here and we have to move. If I could build a building on 
Freedom Square
, before the Blue Line is built, we can actually provide places for people to move when they have to move. Right now, if we have to move, we have to move completely off the Northside,” Brown said.
Brown, along with some West Broadway merchants, are also asking for parking. Brown particularly wants to be able to accommodate loading and unloading to and from his shop. “When I have deliveries and stuff, where are they gonna stop at? Because if they stop in front of my shop to deliver, they’re stopping all traffic,” Brown said. Though the current design plans don’t appear to make provisions for parking, planners at an April 15 open house unveiled a concept plan to make some on-street parking available around West Broadway and Penn. 
 


 


Next steps
Hennepin County and the Met Council plan to release a report detailing their anti-displacement recommendations later this month. The report will then be available for a two-month public comment period. The county and the Met Council anticipate including concrete implementation steps and cost estimates in a plan to be released in August. “We want to first make sure that the intervention and the strategies that we’re going to be pursuing are meeting the needs,” Mianulli said. 
Meanwhile, representatives from Hennepin County, the Blue Line Coalition, and cities along the corridor spoke earlier this month at a Senate Transportation Committee hearing in favor of 
Senate File 4719
, which would allocate $10 million annually over the next seven years to support anti-displacement efforts. The money could be used to fund affordable housing, keep renters and businesses in place along the extension corridor, as well as ensure the project and the surrounding neighborhood honors the heritage of local residents. The bill proposes a 16-member board chaired by the Met Council chair and composed of seven local elected officials and eight community representatives to determine how the money is allocated.  
The Met Council also applied for, but didn’t get, a 
$1.9 million federal grant
 to fund cities and the Met Council’s research into implementing some anti-displacement strategies not just for the Blue Line Extension, but for three additional rapid bus routes serving the East Side of St. Paul over the next three years. They also planned to use the grant to fund 15 organizations to further refine the recommendations, as well as to hire someone to oversee the process.
Trying to stay put
Even with the anti-displacement ideas, some residents and businesses don’t want to be moved. One of them is the J&J Furniture Outlet on West Broadway. The proprietors of J&J Furniture Outlet, along with some of their affected neighbors, learned about the potential for demolition through a community member, even though project planners identified their properties for demolition 
as early as 2022
 and Hennepin County says they sent letters to the impacted properties. 
“I think that’s just disrespectful for the community and the hard work my grandfather had put in, especially coming from the adversity that he faced being a Black man and coming up to Minnesota to create opportunity and create generational wealth and equity for his future grandchildren, his children,” says Jarron Williams, a third-generation owner of J&J Furniture, located at West Broadway, Sheridan, and 26th Avenues in north Minneapolis. 
In the Harrison neighborhood, residents are still reeling from the impacts of a proposed light rail line, even though it left. As planners decided how to build light rail on Olson Memorial Highway, residents and 
research done by CURA
 found property values, property taxes, and rents in the neighborhood increased.
The Harrison Neighborhood Association asked residents about what investments they wanted to see. Residents want 
Olson Highway to be removed
, as well as $1 million to fund assistance for renters, $2 million plus tax forgiveness to help low-income residents buy and maintain their homes in the Harrison neighborhood, 300 public housing units, a grocery store on a Met Council-owned property, as well as to preserve four existing lots used to grow produce. 
As anti-displacement work is underway, cities along the corridor this summer will have the opportunity to vote on whether they want the Met Council to build the Blue Line through their communities. The full Met Council will vote to set the process in motion on 
July 24
.

Kailez Campbell, a 20-year-old student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, grew up playing soccer in Blaine, which is home to the National Sports Center, the world’s largest amateur sports facility, according to the company.
In an effort to upgrade the facility, the Blaine City Council last week approved $12 million in property tax abatement to help fund the installation of 10 new artificial turf fields. But Campbell, as well as Blaine City Council member Lori Saroya and other residents, have voiced concerns about the potential for forever chemicals in the synthetic turf.
“Blaine has an identity as a major soccer city, and that means decisions about our sports infrastructure impacts countless young athletes and their families,” Campbell said. “With so many kids and young adults playing on these fields, the potential exposure and its lifelong health implications are a significant concern for our community.”
 


 


As the January 2025 date that a statewide ban on the chemicals approaches, and the debate around how to regulate the forever chemicals picks up steam nationwide, Saroya and others are calling on the city to do more research and public engagement before going forward with the project.

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known commonly as PFAS, are man-made, long lasting chemicals used in countless types of commercial and industrial products that have been found to have contaminated waterways and negatively affected wildlife and the environment at large. The substances can be breathed in, ingested or absorbed via skin, leading to severe health impacts, including several types of cancer.
“We don’t have the information, our city has not done the research and we haven’t read the studies that are out there,” Saroya said in an interview. “We don’t know the impact that the turf fields will have on children in the long run, and so all we’re asking is we need to do our due diligence to ensure that these turf fields are safe.”
Amara’s Law, passed by Minnesota lawmakers last session, bans the sales of 11 categories of products that have PFAS intentionally added to them starting in 2025. The new law, which many have called the most robust PFAS legislation in the nation, also includes new reporting of PFAS in products by 2026 and a ban on all nonessential uses of the forever chemicals by 2032.
 


 


Among the 11 categories banned by the new law is carpets and rugs, which is described by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency as any fabric intended for use as a floor covering and includes car floor mats, outdoor rugs and synthetic turf.
 


 


In a statement, city spokesman Ben Hayle said city staff contacted the National Sports Center last week to ask about the possible presence of PFAS in the synthetic turf planned for the proposed project. FieldTurf, the company that manufactures the turf fields, told the city that no PFAS of concern were found in the fibers it manufactures.
“Even further the turf was tested for all PFAS and based on that evaluation, the detection of very low levels of a limited number of PFAS in the synthetic turf components did not represent a human health risk to those using the synthetic turf,” Haynes said in the statement. 
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom late last year signed into law a bill that allows local governments to implement its own artificial turf bans, which undoes a previous law that prevented local governments from doing that during a time when artificial turf was seen as a remedy during extreme drought conditions. The reversal came as more became known about PFAS and its health risks, and more states nationwide are proposing and passing legislation to regulate the chemical.
 


 


Saroya raised concerns about the potential for PFAS in an email to the city engineer, who told the council member that the proposed project had been through a watershed permitting process and was granted a permit on April 8. But the engineer also made clear that city staff only reviews plans related to grading, fencing and lighting but does not review or certify the installation of the fields.
Going forward, Saroya said the city should hold off on the project until the city can do a proper environmental impact study on the new fields, while informing Blaine residents of the project and engaging them each step of the way, citing the other local governments in California and around the nation that are grappling with how to regulate turf that contains PFAS.
“For us to not even have that debate is what’s really concerning to me,” she said. “Let’s have that debate, let’s inform residents, let’s be transparent and open about it and have that conversation before we invest $12 million into this and regret it a year from now.”

When Brittney Baker was recognized by St. Paul City Council last month for her promotion to St. Paul Fire Department captain, Fire Chief Butch Inks shared words of advice with the council: 
“If you ever plan a meeting with Brittney Baker and it’s in public, I encourage you to make it longer than the allotted time,” Inks said. 
Why? Because people always want to talk to Baker “because she is so well connected in the community and so devoted to giving back,” the fire chief explained. 
 


 


The historic all-woman St. Paul City Council declared March 27 “Brittney Baker Day,” recognizing Baker’s achievement and the significance of her promotion to captain. 
She is the first African American woman to be promoted to captain. But Baker and her supporters emphasized that her work goes beyond her identity. The ordinance recognized her passion for “not just opening the door, but making sure the door never closes again” through teaching and community work.

“I’m not a person who thinks about diversity in terms of just white and Black. I think diversity is a mindset,” Baker said a month into her new job. “It’s about getting people to think differently about themselves, about the way that we take care of each other as a society.”
For Baker, this means going into the community to teach and serve. 
 


 


There’s a reason so many people know her. Baker is a lifetime resident of St. Paul and a “Rondo baby.” She graduated from Central High School and her family still resides in historic Rondo. 
She teaches free CPR classes. She also teaches the St. Paul Fire Department EMS Academy with two former EMS academy graduates. She helps teach first responder, EMT and paramedic classes at Century College, and she is an instructor for the Department of Transportation. She is also a proud Girl Scout troop leader.

At the council meeting recognizing her achievements and community commitment, Baker read a poem she wrote titled “Is it Worth the Cost?,” which can be heard in the recording of the 
March 27 council meeting at timestamp 27:45.

In her poem, Baker spoke about her commitment to those who come before and after her: “I want those before me to receive their flowers and credit, and those after me to be able to take out a proper loan without ever feeling less than. We pay it forward so we never have to walk in debt to those who don’t love us or want to see us succeed. In the space I felt the most free in this fire service, I am reminded of something: That when you’re accustomed to privilege, equality can feel like oppression. Yeah, just go ahead and let it sink in.” 
 


 


Her career and facing persistent racism 
First attending the St. Paul Fire EMS Academy, Baker began her career in 2012. But just about three weeks into her first EMT class, her father was shot and she saw how paramedics took care of him; one of whom was a woman. This interaction between her father and first responders stuck with Baker. 
Baker started her career as a first responder for Regions Emergency Medical Services and the basic life support unit for the St. Paul Fire Department. She wore many hats, working as an EMT, a certified nursing assistant and a first responder.
There she learned while people claim not to care what the person who takes care of them looks like, that isn’t true for all people. 
“Some people do care. And I know because I’ve had patients call me the N word,” she said. “I’ve had patients tell me they didn’t want me touching them, that they would rather put me back in a field than allow me to take care of them. I’ve had people when I was working in the hospital refuse an EKG to be done and we were short beds that night and I was the only tech on.” 
 


 


The patient waited until a white tech came on hours later, Baker said. 
From these experiences, Baker said it’s important to her to not only reach people who think positively of her, but people who think negatively about her and her abilities too. 
Her message is simple: “I’m qualified to do the job and not because I’m an African American female, but because I have the qualifications, because I have the education, because I’ve done the work. Some people, no matter how many times you say that, will still discredit you.”
Baker became a firefighter in 2018, a fire equipment operator in 2023 and, now in 2024, a captain.

Identity comes in many parts 
Baker clarified that she prefers to be identified as African American rather than Black. Baker said she doesn’t want people to forget the second part of the identity African American. “I am an American with African roots. I’m not just a Black girl. I am proud of both, but I don’t want anyone to forget that. Because sometimes people forget the second part (American).”
During a studying abroad trip in Australia, Baker said one of the many things that resonated with her while overseas was that “I wasn’t the Black girl or the African American girl there. I was the American girl. That was the first time in my life I had simply been called American. So when we go to other places and the rest of the world views us, they view us as distinctly American. We are the ones to separate ourselves.”
Baker said she is a firefighter, a captain, an EMS educator, a mother, a wife and a teacher, noting that she happens to be American and Black. “I’m very proud of that. But don’t forget all the other pieces first.”

St. Paul is a diverse community filled with many people who hold many parts, Baker said. It’s one of many things she loves about her city. This showed when she received her recognition at council. She was honored the same day the
 council passed an ordinance that officially recognized Ramadan. 
Baker said she was honored to be present for the Ramadan recognition. Her grandfather is Muslim. She has friends who are Muslim. To her, sharing that day with the Muslim community was special and meaningful. 
“St Paul is a melting pot. When people disregard cultures – here, we can’t do that. We have a multitude of people, a multitude of cultures who are represented here and who make us quite beautiful,” Baker said. 
Rondo babies recognize Rondo babies 
The recognition of Baker was sponsored by all seven St. Paul City Council members last month, many of whom have ties to Baker and her Rondo roots. 
Ward 3 Council Member Saura Jost, like Baker, is a Central High alumni. 
“I’m so proud of all of the work you’ve done, your lifelong dedication and commitment to our city. I know that that work will be felt for decades to come. And I’m also just really excited to see what you’ll do next,” said Jost. 
Ward 1 Council Member Anika Bowie congratulated Baker during the March meeting.
“I have seen you present, rooted in community, all throughout,”  Bowie said. “I remember my time being an educator, being a youth worker and you were there building up the village. You were there building up the pipeline of opportunities. You have always been there. You have been an inspiration not only to myself as a council member, but also as a Rondo baby who’s proud to be Rondo raised. I’m just so honored to share a village with you.”

The family of Ricky Cobb II, the 33-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by a Minnesota state trooper last summer, announced on Wednesday a federal lawsuit against the troopers involved in the incident.
The civil lawsuit seeking monetary damages names troopers Ryan Londregan and Brett Seide and alleges they violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments via unreasonable seizure and use of excessive force when the troopers tried to forcibly remove Cobb from the vehicle and fired shots into the car.
Cobb was killed in July during a traffic stop on Interstate 94 in north Minneapolis for driving without lights. During the stop, the troopers learned that Cobb II had allegedly violated a protective order in Ramsey County and moved  to arrest him. 
 


 


The troopers – Seide on the driver’s side and Londregan on the passenger door side – opened Cobb’s car doors in an effort to pull him out of the vehicle. When the vehicle began moving forward Londregan fired two shots that hit Cobb in the torso, killing him. 
The news conference announcing the lawsuit was attended by Cobb’s parents, siblings and the mothers of his three children, who talked about how their children are dealing with the loss of their father.

“Imagine your children walking out the door every day to go out to school and having to say goodbye to an urn instead of their actual parent,” said Danielle Pickett, the mother of two of Cobb’s sons. “They don’t have a father and we’re left to raise little boys without their dad being present.”

Cobb family attorney Harry Daniels told reporters Wednesday that the suit does not name the state of Minnesota due to the Eleventh amendment in the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits federal courts from hearing certain lawsuits brought by individuals against a U.S. state. The lawsuit differs in the regard from suits brought against the city of Minneapolis in addition to the officers involved in George Floyd’s murder, and the suit brought against Brooklyn Center in Daunte Wright’s death, which ended in settlements of $27 million and $3.5 million, respectively. 
 


 


Daniels, along with attorneys Bakari Sellers and F. Clayton Tyler, did not rule out filing a lawsuit in state court as well, being well within the six-year statute of limitations to do so.

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has been under fire since late January after bringing criminal charges against Londregan, which include second-degree unintentional murder, first-degree assault and second-degree manslaughter. 
Several state and congressional Republican lawmakers, as well as the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, have called on Gov. Tim Walz to take the case from Moriarty after claims from Londregan’s attorneys that Moriarty ignored testimony from a use of force expert that said the trooper did not use excessive force. Moriarty’s office has denied those claims. 
Walz has commented publicly multiple times on the case and whether to remove it from Moriarty’s office, which the governor has done once before with the case involving the killing of Zaria McKeever. 
 


 


McKeever, 23, was killed in November 2022 when her adult ex-boyfriend arranged for two teenage brothers, ages 15 and 17 at the time, to kill McKeever’s new partner but one of the teens killed McKeever instead. 
In that case, Walz reassigned it to Attorney General Keith Ellison
 after McKeever’s family expressed concern that a proposed plea deal from Moriarty’s office for the teens was too lenient. 
The governor told reporters on Wednesday that while Ellison has not yet requested the case be taken away from the Hennepin County attorney, he’s still considering whether to make that move. 
“We want justice to be served; we want fairness,” Walz said. “I take this move on removing a case, either at the request of the attorney general or by our move, very seriously so I think we’re still in that holding pattern.”
Sellers said Wednesday that he’s disappointed and “pissed off” at the politicization of the case and the calls from elected officials to reassign the case. Despite that, he said they’ll continue to seek justice for the family and that he’s confident Walz will make “the right decision.”
 


 


“Politics aside, we’ll let people get reelected, we’ll let people support who they support, but we stand squarely on our 10 toes and we will go toe to toe with whomever is in front of us to get to that goal of justice,” he said.

D.C. Memo
 | A recap of a week’s worth of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. 


































Sign up


















 


WASHINGTON — In what’s likely to be the hottest congressional race in the state, Rep. Ilhan Omar’s rematch with Democratic challenger Don Samuels is playing out on a different field this year.
This is a high-stakes race because whoever wins the August primary will most likely be sent to Washington to represent the Minneapolis-based 5
th
 District in the next Congress. The district is one of the most Democratic-leaning congressional districts in the state.    
Samuels, 74, nearly defeated Omar in a primary two years ago; only about 2% points separated the rivals. Back then, Samuels’ candidacy was bolstered by his campaign to portray Omar as soft on crime and he made much of the lawmaker’s support for a failed amendment that would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety.
 


 


But polls show crime is not as much of a concern among voters than it was two years ago. So, although public safety continues to be a campaign plank, Samuels has tried to differentiate himself from Omar in other ways.
Initially, Samuels focused his differences with Omar on how to address the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Samuels slammed the Minneapolis City Council — which once counted him among its members — when it approved a symbolic resolution in January calling for an immediate and permanent cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war; humanitarian aid to Palestine; an end to U.S. military funding to Israel and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.
Omar agreed with the resolution’s positions. But Samuels said the resolution “served to divide neighbors from one another.”
 


 


Samuels also condemned Omar for voting against a congressional resolution approved shortly after Hamas attacked Israel in October that aimed to show continued U.S. support of Israel.
His stance helped the Samuels campaign win support from several noted pro-Israel donors, including financier Jeffrey Schoenfeld and energy executive Richard Plutzer, who have also donated to the campaigns of the Democratic challengers to Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri and Summer Lee of Pennsylvania – members of a progressive group of lawmakers known as the “squad.”
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has targeted Bush, Summer, Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York and other squad members, including Omar, for their criticisms of Israel and pledged $100 million to support pro-Israel candidates — and oust targeted progressives. But the politically powerful organization hasn’t spent any money — yet — to help Samuels.
“We are currently evaluating primary races involving detractors of the U.S.-Israel relationship,” AIPAC spokesman Marshall Wittman said. “We are already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact.”
 


 


AIPAC contributed $350,000 to the United Democracy Project, an allied group created to boost Samuels. But Samuels complained that the help was too little, too late.
Omar has used the threat posed by AIPAC to raise money for her campaign.

“Dark money super PACs like AIPAC donated huge sums of money to amplify Ilhan’s opponent last cycle and are preparing to do so again to defeat our movement,” Omar’s campaign wrote in a digital solicitation. “We need all of the support we can get to fight back and WIN.”
Omar told MinnPost
 
that AIPAC has “always played in my primary races and it’s not going to be different this year.”
 


 


But she said the 5
th
 District’s “educated and committed voters” have always rejected attempts to unseat her. “I am confident they will do that again,” she said.
She also said the 5
th
 District is “the most anti-war district” in the nation, based on the number of calls and letters she receives and the demonstrations that occur every weekend in the district.
“They are persistent in calling for peace,” Omar said of her constituents.
Omar’s campaign has raised nearly $4.9 million for her re-election and already spent more than half that money fending off Samuels, who only began raising money late last year and has raised more than $775,000.
 


 


Public shift on Israel-Hamas war impacts race
One problem for Samuels is that public support for Omar’s position on the strife in the Middle East has grown as civilian Palestinian casualties mount, a shift that could be measured in the strength of the protest vote of Democrats who chose “uncommitted” over President Joe Biden in several party primaries this year, including the one in Minnesota.
Palestinian casualties and difficulties delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza posed by the Israeli government have frustrated Biden and prompted him to take a harder line toward Israel, although this weekend’s attack on the U.S. ally by Iran could once again alter the equation.
Omar was quick to put out a statement condemning Tehran for its attack – and also condemned the Israelis for their assassination of an Iranian general at a diplomatic post in Syria that provoked retaliation from Iran.
“As leaders in Washington jump to call for war with Iran and rush additional offensive weapons to the Israeli military, we need to exercise restraint and use every diplomatic tool to de-escalate tensions,” Omar said in a statement.

Like Biden and many Americans, Samuels has shifted his stance on the Middle East, too.
“Over time, the conflict of Israel in Palestine has become so frightening that  everybody agrees it is too extreme and I do, too,” Samuels said. “We need a ceasefire, and we need a return of all of the (Israeli) hostages. But at the end of the day, the damage has been done in the Jewish community because they don’t think (Omar) cares.”  
Samuels also said the way Omar approached the crisis in the Middle East “is really consistent with her tendency to exacerbate conflict rather than bringing healing and bringing people together.”
“When you have a real conflict, that really brings out the worst in her, in that she picks a side and is unable to weigh the value of each side,” he said.
Yet David Schultz, a Hamline University political science professor, said “the Israeli-Gaza war has bailed Omar out.”
“A lot of people are saying she’s right in criticizing Israel,” Schultz said.
‘Pragmatic’ progressive v. progressive
Samuels calls himself a “pragmatic progressive” who has sided with Omar on many issues, including the need to protect abortion rights and fight climate change and homelessness.
“I will always pull against the chain for change, but I’m very pragmatic about it,” he said.
Like Omar, who was born in Somalia, Samuels is an immigrant.
A Jamaican by birth, Samuels went to college in the United States and became an industrial designer. But after a 30-year career, Samuels said he felt a calling for public service. He lives in North Minneapolis and works to aid low-income communities. Besides serving on the City Council, Samuels has also held a seat on the Minnesota Board of Education.
Omar, 41, served in Minnesota’s House of Representatives before she was elected to Congress in 2018.
A lightning rod for the  right wing, Omar has faced well-funded rivals in both primary and general elections and won them handily — until Samuels came close to defeating her in 2022.
She has ramped up her campaigning this year. Besides raising and spending more money on the primary election, Omar said she has organized on the caucus level “to get the most delegates at the district convention.”
Omar will need those delegates because the first big showdown with Samuels will occur on May 11 at the district’s nominating convention.
Samuels said he will try to block the DFL from endorsing Omar as its favored candidate for the 5th District seat. That’s something he nearly accomplished two years ago when the congresswoman failed to win the support of at least 60% of the delegates on a first ballot.
“That was unprecedented,” Samuels said.
Omar also said she is “fully onboarding” a campaign staff for the primary.
“The way we conducted our campaign in 2022 was an outlier,” Omar said. “We were preserving our resources for the general election. … We just had a different tactic in 2022.”
Omar is very actively promoting her efforts to secure federal money for special projects in the district. She recently began showcasing each one of the 15 earmarks she procured this year — many for non-profits that work to help veterans and immigrants and expand affordable housing — in a weekly event she calls “Funding Fridays.”
She has also secured the endorsements of seven mayors in her district — four more than she won two years ago.  Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has endorsed Samuels in 2022. 
One thing has not changed in this election cycle. As Samuels agrees with much of Omar’s progressive agenda and has adopted her calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, he continues to focus on how Omar expresses herself, calling her approach “divisive.”
“Tone-policing women, especially women of color, has been a tactic that has been used to attack us,” Omar said. “And I believe that it is important for me to be decisive, to lead with integrity, to have clarity, to be accountable to my constituents, to be transparent and to be able to communicate with my constituents in a way that I feel is necessary.”
The Samuels campaign has recently released an internal poll that showed he was virtually running neck-and-neck with Omar.
Yet political scientist Schultz said, “I think (Omar) looks stronger now than she did two years ago.
One reason? Schultz said AIPAC support for her rivals “is becoming toxic.”
Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics said “Omar is right to take the primary very seriously.” But Kondik also said Omar is in a much better position to win re-election than some of her squad colleagues.
“The conventional wisdom seems to be that, of the most left-wing House Dems, Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush are in the most trouble. Part of that involves scandals unique to them,” Kondik said.
There are also two other Democrats challenging Omar: attorney Sarah Gad and former Air Force officer Tim Peterson, who has raised $17,822 for his campaign. Gad has not filed her latest campaign finance report, but had raised about $86,000 in campaign cash as of the end of last year.
Whoever wins August’s primary election would likely face Dalia Al-Aqidi, who is the only GOP candidate in the race, although there is time for another Republican to file for candidacy. Al-Aqidi has already raised more than $578,000 for her campaign.

Over the next few months, decisions at the state Legislature around rideshare could go beyond setting minimum rates for drivers. Already, some legislators are debating whether or not the state’s local governments should have the power to regulate transportation networks at all. 
Eyes were on Minneapolis City Council Thursday as council voted to delay the implementation of its minimum rates rideshare ordinance, but interest in the future implications of this ordinance extend beyond the city. A working group led by House Majority Leader Jamie Long and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy is working on a statewide solution that doesn’t preempt the Minneapolis City Council’s action. Council leaders are part of that effort. 
Long said Thursday that the state bill is getting “very close” and he was grateful that Minneapolis City Council extended its ordinance implementation date. 
 


 


“We have a lot of stakeholders in that conversation – the city, the Legislature, the governor, companies – so these are certainly discussions that can take time. I think having until the end of session instead of a May 1 deadline will be helpful,” Long said.  
Gov. Tim Walz called the delay “good news.” 
“There’s nothing wrong with saying, ‘Look, we can step back,’” Walz said. “Maybe there’s some things we didn’t think about here, maybe there are some things we can collaborate together on.” 
Walz added that May 1st was “simply not doable” and the delay gives the Legislature time to make the regulation “a little more uniform.”
 


 


But some lawmakers are looking for more concrete assurance that Uber and Lyft will not leave. Hours after council’s vote, DFL legislators fended off a Thursday attempt by GOP lawmakers to block local governments from regulating rideshare companies. 
What happened in the Senate
During the state Senate session yesterday, a motion was made by Sen. Zach Duckworth, R-Lakeville, to 
retroactively remove local authority to regulate rideshare
. The amendment would have been added to House file 3436, an omnibus transportation bill, but ultimately Senate democrats voted that this amendment was non germane to the bill.

State Sen. Zach Duckworth
A non germane amendment includes one which relates to a substantially different subject or is intended to accomplish a substantially different purpose than that of the original bill to which it is proposed.
Sens. Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis, and Matt Klein, DFL-Mendota Heights, argued the amendment would not be appropriate for the transportation bill because it directly impacts the powers of local government, which they argued should be addressed by the State and Local Government Committee. 
 


 


“The bill seeks to preempt ordinances of local government. These are discussions of extreme and serious policy consequence,” Dibble said. 
Duckworth, along with other GOP senators, argued the amendment was germane. 
“This amendment is germane to the transportation policy bill as it impacts the transportation services of the entire state of Minnesota,” Duckworth said. 
The senate voted 34 to 31 to uphold that the amendment was non germane. 
 


 


Preemption 
If the GOP amendment to the omnibus transportation bill had been adopted Thursday and the bill passed and signed, it would have qualified as a state preemption. Preemption is a legal doctrine that allows upper levels of government to restrict or prevent a lower-level government from self-regulating.
State Rep. Jamie Long
House Majority Leader Long, DFL-Minneapolis, one of lead negotiators working with the state House, Senate and governor on a rideshare bill, talked briefly about preemption in a discussion with reporters earlier that day. 
“I think that we will get to a result that’s going to keep the company’s operating and it’s going to protect the drivers,” Long said. “I’m really hoping that we can avoid preemption. I personally oppose preemption. I have for years. It’s been a tool that’s been tried in the US in the past to stop cities from often being the engines of democracy … So I would really prefer we don’t go down that path.”
Minneapolis City Council delays ordinance
Earlier on Thursday, Minneapolis council voted unanimously to delay implementation of its minimum rates rideshare ordinance, which would require companies to pay $1.40 per mile and $0.51 per minute to drivers. 
 


 


Uber and Lyft have claimed these rates are too high and threatened  to leave if enforced. Now the enforcement date has been extended from May 1 to July 1, the companies say they will remain in the city for an additional two months, forgoing a planned May 1 departure. 
 


 


Amid discussion around the ordinance to delay, work in progress with the state was one reason council members had for pushing the implementation date. 
Minneapolis Council Member Aurin Chowdhury
Before the council’s vote, Aurin Chowdhury, chair of the Intergovernmental Relations Committee, said the extension provides time for local approval for special state legislation. 
“I’ve been talking consistently with state legislative leaders on their respective legislative process, and they have yet to decide on key components of their bill and are really looking to us to work on our side and complete our policy as they’re completing their bill,” she said. “They’re asking that there is time for us to collaborate together (and) move through our respective processes.” 
Four local rideshare companies, which include one co-op, are in the process of completing applications and getting licensed, Chowdhury said, noting this process takes time. 
Council members cited the time needed for these companies looking to serve as an Uber and Lyft alternative to build and establish themselves. Additionally, this would give more time for the more than 10,000 rideshare drivers in the Twin Cities metro to sign secure employment outside of Uber and Lyft. 
However, some council members were skeptical that these startups could establish enough of a footing in two months to compensate for Uber and Lyft’s departure. 
Minneapolis Council Member Linea Palmisano
Two additional ordinances were proposed at the meeting. Ward 13 Council Member Linea Palmisano proposed eliminating  the rideshare ordinance passed by council in March altogether. This motion failed 3 to 10. 
Council Members Andrea Jenkins, Ward 8, and Emily Koski, Ward 11, brought another proposed motion to the board to lower the per-mile rate of the ordinance council passed in March from $1.40 to $1.21 per mile, which is the rate recommended in the state report. This would have maintained the same $0.51 per minute rate in the Minneapolis ordinance, which is higher than the state’s recommended $0.49 per minute. This motion also failed 3 to 10. 
The issue of data 
Much of the debate around what rates are sufficient to reach minimum wage for workers revolves around what study should be used to determine said rates. 
Minneapolis City Council passed the rideshare ordinance a day before the 
state study that included recommended rates was released
. The minimum wage rates council used in its ordinance are based off of 2019 Seattle rideshare drivers earnings. 
This has been a continual point of contention brought up by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who vetoed council’s March ordinance but was ultimately overridden by a council. 
The mayor plans to let council’s extension to July 1 pass, but plans to neither veto or sign it. 
“
A delay is not a fix,” Frey said in a statement. “While Council continues to make a mess of this, I’ll be working with policymakers and partners from across the disability, hospitality, and business communities to find a path forward for drivers and riders.”
Correction: this story has been updated to correct when the council first adopted the ordinance. It was the day before state study release, not the day after.

The chairs of the two legislative transportation committees have given up for now on changing how the Met Council is governed. The two Minneapolis DFLers haven’t, however, given up on changing how the regional government manages its biggest and most well-known projects.
Sen. Scott Dibble renewed his push to shift construction responsibility for future light rail and bus rapid transit projects from the Met Council to the state Department of Transportation. And Rep. Frank Hornstein is presiding over a committee push to restrict the council from spending any of the money from a new seven-county transportation sales tax on light rail projects. 
Both moves come after their failed push last fall and winter to significantly change how the Met Council is governed. The current council is made up of 17 part-time members appointed from the region by the governor. Hornstein had supported making the council members elected and Dibble had crafted a hybrid plan that combined an elected council and a council of governments made up of local elected officials from the seven-county region. 
No proposal had a majority
 of a special task force that met from August of 2023 to February.
 


 


While neither Dibble nor Hornstein has offered legislation related to the task force work, both indicated in an interview that their work this session does stem from their disappointment with the failure of the task force to reach agreement.
“The task force, if anything, put us further behind,” Dibble said this week. “It entrenched resistance to change. Everyone dug in further to the positions they brought into the conversation.
“The bottom line is we don’t have the votes in the Legislature,” he added. “We have to take it to the people. There has to be a political movement built up around the case for change.”
Hornstein said he thought the task force work was productive because it did discuss different ideas for running a regional agency like the Met Council. He said Dibble’s hybrid proposal for a combination of an elected council and a panel of local officials is the direction the region should go. It just didn’t lead to a consensus among the people appointed to the task force.
 


 


“Certainly, there are a lot of powerful interests that are fine with the status quo,” Hornstein said, adding that there was some agreement around the need for more transparency and accountability for the Met Council and its Metro Transit.
Both chairs believe Met Council staff improperly interfered with the workings of the task force. That conclusion is based partly on 
MinnPost reporting
 that showed contacts between council staff and task force members before they publicly accused a Met Council critic of a conflict of interest.

It was that report, as well as their own observations of Met Council staff’s interactions with sympathetic task force members, that contributed to Dibble’s decision to push for the removal of future construction work from the Met Council.
“The Met Council has vociferously defended its prerogative to be completely beyond the reach of any elected board or body or entity-active effort to undermine that policy idea,” Dibble told his committee last week. “So we’re not moving forward with that this year because they’ve been quite successful.”
 


 


The Met Council has denied that it acted improperly during the task force process with Chair Charlie Zelle saying his staff was responding to a request for information from a task force member who is also a state legislator. It has also defended itself from accusations and 
ethics complaints filed
 by task force member Myron Orfield.
Two proposals
The ban on using the new sales tax on light rail is contained in 
an amendment
 that will be presented to the House Transportation Committee by Rep. Fue Lee. The Minneapolis DFLer will seek to amend his own 
House File 5182
, which would order the Met Council to submit an annual financial review to the Legislature that provides financial details about the council’s transportation budget, as well as its forecasted spending.
“That comes directly out of the task force discussion even though it’s not a governance change,” Hornstein said. 
One of the major provisions of last year’s transportation bill 
was a seven-county sales tax of 0.75%.
 The proceeds of nearly $500 million a year will be the first dedicated state-adopted tax revenue for transportation, with most going to transit.
 


 


“We want to make sure we really put some guardrails and some specifics about its use,” Hornstein said. “Without that kind of strong legislative oversight and direction, who knows. For example, I don’t think it should be used for light rail.
“This is the future of transit,” he added. “We have to make sure it is used for the purposes we outlined in the omnibus bill.”

Member of Met Council task force accuses agency of unethical conduct


The backstory on 20 minutes of awkwardness at Met Council governance task force shows why consensus will be hard to reach


Does panel’s lack of consensus on Met Council’s structure prove the futility of task forces?
An existing sales tax dedicated to transportation that is imposed by, and collected by, Ramsey and Hennepin Counties has been a major source of funding for light rail projects.
Terri Dresen, the director of communications for the Met Council, said the governing body would not comment on potential amendments until the committee formally considers them.
 


 


The transfer of authority of construction projects is in 
Senate File 1625
 that Dibble held a hearing on last session but did not advance. He renewed the push last week.
 


 


“We can have the Department of Transportation build these massive construction projects that the Met Council cannot do,” Dibble told his committee April 3. “They are incompetent and incapable of it. They don’t have the experience, the culture. They have a record of failure.”
He 
cited reports 
that contractors building the Southwest Light Rail Transit project laid commuter tracks too close to existing freight rail tracks. “It’s never ending. It’s relentless,” Dibble said.
The Met Council did not testify on the bill, but Dresen said the council is interested in working with the Legislature on how projects are done.
“We also recognize the Legislature has the right to continually evaluate how the state’s major transit investments are overseen and delivered, and we will continue to work closely with all of our partners, including the Legislature, to share how we are improving our work to ensure the next project builds on lessons learned from the last,” Dresen said in response to questions about the Dibble bill.
Nancy Daubenberger, the commissioner of the state Department of Transportation, thanked Dibble for his confidence in the agency but opposed the bill. MnDOT has its hands full with the projects it already has, she said, and is having trouble filling its own jobs. Yet the SWLRT staff alone is equal to what MnDOT has in its Twin Cities region.
“The Met Council is the regional planning entity and operator of the transit system and has institutional knowledge related to this,” Daubenberger told the Senate Transportation Committee. “Therefore, the Met Council should manage the construction of their system as MnDOT manages construction of projects on our system.”
The GOP lead on the committee, Sen. John Jasinski of Faribault, agreed with Daubenberger’s concerns about staffing and said he was leery of the department being distracted from projects in Greater Minnesota to take on huge projects in the Twin Cities.
“We would be concerned about taking away what MnDOT is delivering to us in Greater Minnesota and the Metro to oversee some of these projects,” he said.
Dibble said that MnDOT would get the money now being spent by the Met Council and that some of the current staff could be absorbed by MnDOT.
“There’s a way to do this. I have faith in the Department of Transportation that we can figure this out,” he said. 
Dibble said later that “I’m encouraging the governor to support my bill. This is an opportunity to do something that is meaningful, that we are trying to address what is abundantly obvious.”
Gov. Tim Walz, who appoints the chair of the Met Council and the 16 other council members as well as Daubenberger, said Wednesday he is open to talking about the issue.
“Anything that moves toward more efficiency and better stewardship of projects and taxpayer dollars is smart,” Walz said. “MnDOT has a very, very good reputation on these things and the Met Council has delivered on some really great projects. Southwest Light Rail has been a little different animal so we’re open to hearing them.” 
He said he shared Daubenberger’s concerns about staffing.
“The experts at MnDOT say, ‘Quite honestly, we just don’t have the capacity,’” Walz said. He cited the recently approved $1.8 billion replacement of the Blatnik Bridge between Duluth and Superior, Wisconsin, as an example of some of the work ahead. “These big projects over multiple jurisdictions are a real challenge.”

St. Paul looks to one-sided winter street parking,https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2024/04/st-paul-looks-to-one-sided-winter-street-parking/,2024-04-10,,https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/StPaulPublicWorksSnowPlow940.png,"Daily Newsletter

For many Twin Cities drivers, the post snowstorm reshuffle is almost second nature. 
If you park on the street, it’s a wintertime given (most years at least) that – at some point – you’ll have to brave the bitter cold, trudge to the car and hope it starts. If the engine revs, the next test is to see if the car can traverse the short drive to the correct block or side of the street to make way for plows. 
This has been the protocol in St. Paul for as long as Mayor Melvin Carter can remember. 
 


 


Now, the mayor says it’s time to consider a “fundamentally different strategy.” 
The city is exploring the implementation of one-sided street parking from November to March. The earliest this would be implemented could be the winter of 2025-2026. This alternative parking measure would be in lieu of the parking protocol currently used during snow emergencies, officials said during a media briefing last week with Carter and the St. Paul Department of Public Works. 
Under the proposal, which city officials have been considering for about a year, cars on residential streets would shift from parking on one side of the street to the other on a weekly basis throughout the winter. This would leave two-thirds of the street clear at all times for snow plows to push snow to the curb.
Under this model, the city would still be able to call snow emergencies, which allow for expedited towing and ticketing. But, rather than moving cars in reaction to inclement weather, residents would move their cars on a weekly basis, likely during a Sunday timeframe. 
 


 


This proposed change will not be widely implemented next winter, but the city is looking to launch a pilot in a small residential area that has yet to be determined starting winter of 2024/2025. 
 










Latest from around the metro










 






Rent control is on the St. Paul City Council’s agenda once again
 










 






After latest brutal Southwest LRT audit, some lawmakers question the point of the Met Council 
 










 






St. Paul City Council disagreement reaches boiling point behind closed doors
 






 


Notably, the change would apply to most residential streets, but not to all. St. Paul still needs to do a parking utilization study to identify parts of the city where there is or isn’t capacity for this change, St. Paul Public Works Director Sean Kershaw said. City officials also plan to engage with the community members and neighborhood groups in the near future, and launch an advisory committee within the coming weeks. 
As St. Paul looks to implement this new model, Minneapolis officials say a single-sided street parking ban, outside of particularly snowy winters like last year, is unlikely due to Minneapolis having higher density streets than St. Paul. 
But, when discussing snow emergencies in the Twin Cities, both cities shared the same message: Snow emergencies, as they have been conducted for decades, have nothing to do with snow and everything to do with parking. 
 


 


A deeper look into the St. Paul proposal
The goal in implementing this possible change would be to allow for faster and more efficient snow removal, prioritize clearing residential streets, reduce the need for punitive tickets and towing and make parking rules easier for residents to follow, officials said. 
Under the current snow emergency model, the city tells residents where their cars should be at 9 p.m., 8 a.m., and again at 8 a.m. the next morning after a snow emergency is called, Kershaw said.
“There’s a lot of effort put into where you move your car at what time,” he said. “That creates some of the confusion that leads to tickets. In this new model, if we were to adopt this model, the message during a snow emergency is just keep your car where it should be legally parked. Period.” 
The city is still working out a plan for how it would address streets that don’t work under the one-sided parking model. Some streets are too narrow to make the switch. The proposed plan also would not work for arterial and collector streets like Grand Avenue.
 


 


 


 


The “bird’s eye view” of the program would likely improve cost efficiencies, Carter said, but he emphasized that efficiency in clearing snow so things like ambulance and fire services can get through the street is the city’s priority when rethinking the city’s protocol. 
The mayor acknowledged the new proposal would be a significant change and will need community feedback and buy-in before it is implemented. 
“For as far back as I can remember, we only had one way to clear the city when we had a major snow event,” Carter said.”That in and of itself might be a challenge.”
Would Minneapolis ever try a similar model? 
Could and would Minneapolis make a similar change? Probably not. Minneapolis is more dense than St. Paul, said Joe Paumen with the Minneapolis Department of Public Works. Maybe 40% of Minneapolis’ residential streets would be cohesive to the winter-long single-sided parking ban, he said, emphasizing the word maybe. 
 


 


“I do find it to be an interesting idea,” he said of St. Paul’s proposed change. “What you do deal with, and one of the downsides would be, that snow could be completely adhered and frozen to the other side of the street because it’s not been driven on for a week. So for example, in Minneapolis, we have under bodies on our plows that really have a lot of weight on them that can scrape the street. St. Paul does not (have underbody scrapers). They only have front plows.”
Minneapolis and St. Paul already differ in their approach to snow emergencies
. For example, a St. Paul snow emergency takes two days, while Minneapolis takes three.
And every snow emergency is different, Minneapolis and St. Paul officials said over the past week. Usually a snow emergency is called when around four or more inches of snow have fallen in a given time period, Paumen said, but this isn’t an exact science. For example, as was the case in this year’s March storm, if the forecast says there will be 40-50 degree weather in the days following the storm, that will be factored in before calling a snow emergency. 
“We want to make sure that any action we take can do more good than the hassle it takes for residents to move their vehicles,” Paumen said. 
A swiftly changing climate 
These conversations come after a particularly strange winter. It’s easy to forget last year’s harsh winter as Minnesota nears the end of its most mild winter on record. 
Tracking December through February, the 
Minnesota State Climatology Office’s climate journal 
highlights that this year was the warmest winter on records for almost all department stations (all aside from Duluth, which had its second warmest winter, beat out by the winter of 
1877-78
). The journal is calling this year “the lost winter.”

Metro Transit will rebuild old Blue Line while pondering its extension,https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2024/04/metro-transit-will-rebuild-old-blue-line-while-pondering-its-extension/,2024-04-02,,https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RailCarOnTruck940.png,"Daily Newsletter

Cesar Rodriguez uses the Lake Street/Midtown Station, but only if he needs to go to the nearby Target or the Planet Fitness. 
“That’s the only reason why I use it. The way it’s set up, you have to go around to go up the stairs. Out of sight, out of mind. Some people take advantage of it,” said Rodriguez, referencing the drug use at the station, one Friday as he took the Blue Line to the Mall of America.  
The station layout may soon change. As Metro Transit contemplates extending the Blue Line through north Minneapolis and the northern suburbs, they are about to embark on a project to rebuild some pieces that make up much of the original Blue Line that could cost around $120 million. 
 


 


At least 
$8.75 million
 will go toward a near-complete rebuilding of the Lake Street/Midtown station, according to the agency. Another 
$101 million
 is budgeted toward rebuilding the 
tracks and signals
 between Cedar Riverside and Bloomington Central stations, and another 
$12 million
 may go toward removing rusted structural members from 27 of its oldest light rail trains. 
Since it opened in 2004 as the Hiawatha Line, the Blue Line has carried over 170 million passengers, according to data the agency 
published over
 
the years
. The original segment, from Hennepin Avenue to the Mall of America, cost 
$715.3 million
 to build and was serviced by up to 24 light rail vehicles operating in pairs. With ridership exceeding 
2020 expectations by its first year
, over the next decade, Metro Transit expanded its platforms to handle three-car trains, expanded the size of its two park-and-rides serving the route, built a new light rail station, and bought 20 more light rail vehicles from two different vendors. 
To keep the route and service in shape, Metro Transit has been gradually replacing some of the rail, switches, and signals that tell a train operator where it can go. Metro Transit completed the first part of that work in downtown Minneapolis in 2017, as well as 
rail replacement and signal work
 between Bloomington Central Station and Mall of America in 2022.

Later this spring, they plan to replace rail and signals between 
Bloomington Central Station and Terminal 2 station
 at a cost of $18.6 million. Next year, they plan to do the same work between Cedar-Riverside and Terminal 2; the agency has not released an exact cost figure for that work to ensure a “fair procurement process.”  
 


 


Next year’s rebuild will cause disruptions on Blue Line service, but how it will be disrupted is not clear. “Prior to construction, Metro Transit will launch a communication campaign using its website, social media, text/email alerts, station and vehicle signage, and station ambassadors to promote when and where replacement bus service will be needed,” said Metro Transit spokesperson Drew Kerr. Metro Transit staff expect to present more details to Met Council members at their Transportation Committee meeting on April 8.
While the track and signal work is underway, the agency also plans to completely rebuild the Lake Street-Midtown Station. “It sees a lot of foot traffic, combined with we’ve had sort of an increase at the station of repairs, replacement and damage and vandalism over the past few years,” said project manager Christina Morrison at a November Met Council Transportation Committee meeting. 
The elevators and escalators at the station constantly break down. The agency and some riders are also concerned with people congregating at the station doing drugs. “It’s a terrible place,” said Rodriguez, citing drug use. Agency staff are also worried about harassing behavior, as well as how the station design can contribute to it. 
The agency 
envisioned
 removing the shelters on the platforms and encompassing the entire station under one giant canopy. They may also replace the elevators and escalators with stairways and a ramp, and re-orient the stairways so they face Lake Street, as opposed to being accessed from side doors as they are today. 
 


 


 


 


It’s unclear if the station will be retrofitted with faregates. “A study exploring how existing light rail stations could be improved through a variety of investments, including fare gate systems, will be completed later this year,” Kerr said. 
Design work
 by St. Paul-based 4RM+ULA architects through a $3.5 million contract began 
last month
. 
The agency anticipates construction beginning in 2025 and lasting until the following year. In the meantime, Metro Transit is 
halfway through a contract with Allied Universal
 to provide security services at the station. The agency also replaced the wall panels with repetitive floral pieces designed by Nickyworks Studio in northeast Minneapolis that also has an anti-graffiti coating. “It has reduced graffiti dramatically. You wipe it right off the surface,” Metro Transit Public Art Administrator Mark Granlund said at a March Met Council Transportation Committee meeting.  
Transit rider Craig Warner has mixed opinions about what a renovation might mean for the Lake Street/Midtown Station. “It might help out the situation currently taking place right now, high drug use,” he said as he rode the Blue Line home from shopping at the Mall of America. 
But Warner also wonders if a rebuilt station will be enough to quell drug use. “I’m sure they’ve done all that they can at the moment, there’s not much more they can do than to have more police officers ,” added Warner.
 


 


Meanwhile, work to address rust from 27 of Metro Transit’s first generation light rail vehicles, made by Bombardier Transportation, is underway in Tallulah, Louisiana. Though the agency started addressing rust on those cars in 2017, when they had been in service for around 13 years, they later found the cars had rusted to where its maintenance staff could not handle the workload. 
The union representing Metro Transit maintenance staff says that could have been prevented. “The work should have been done a lot earlier, which would have made it a lot more easier, a lot more efficient,” said Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1005 president David Stiggers. 
Amid opposition from ATU, who did not want the work to be outsourced, the Met Council awarded an up-to-$12 million contract to RailCar, a rail engineering and accident investigation firm, 
in late 2021
 to work on the rail cars. The Met Council also pledged to remove rust from light rail vehicles more often, every seven or eight years, moving forward.  
Meanwhile, three of the first-generation light rail vehicles were trucked out to RailCar’s Louisiana facilities in 2022. The agency expects for them to return this spring with new rust-free structural members. Some of the trains will also have new flooring and wall paneling. 
 


 


John Lehman, a junior at Roosevelt High School, is a fan of riding the Blue Line, particularly the Bombardier trains. “I like how they look and how they sound,” said Lehman as he sat close to the front of the train on his way to the Mall of America one Friday afternoon. 
If all goes well, the work being done by Metro Transit will allow people like Lehman to enjoy the trains for at least 
20 more years
, when Metro Transit expects to retire them.

Ben Graves on the precarious state of Twin Cities hotels,https://www.minnpost.com/twin-cities-business/2024/04/ben-graves-on-the-precarious-state-of-twin-cities-hotels/,2024-04-01,,http://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/InterContinentalHotel750.png,"Daily Newsletter

This story was originally published by 
Twin Cities Business
.
 


Ben Graves, CEO of 
Graves Hospitality Corp.
, has a diverse perspective on the hospitality industry. Graves operates nine hotels in the Twin Cities and several U.S. markets, plus has been an innovator in hotel food and beverage, with a history of operating destination standalone restaurants within and outside the company’s properties. Living in downtown Minneapolis, he has a unique perspective on the challenged local hotel scene and those of other markets where he does business (particularly Oakland, California, and Portland, Oregon).
I spoke to Graves early in the pandemic
, as the industry was bailing water, and thought it would be interesting to revisit four years later (
as with my recent conversation with St. Paul restaurateur Tim Niver
).
The hotel industry received no specific pandemic assistance unlike peer businesses, restaurants, and music/theater venues, though facing similar catastrophic losses. Many in the industry believe Donald Trump’s status as a hotelier made the 2021 Congress unwilling to bail out hotels. The picture Graves paints today is of a localized business, where success is defined by market type rather than broader economic metrics. And as has been the case since 2020, our local market manifests unique challenges.
 


 


End of year reports by CBRE and Meet Minneapolis showed the city’s hotel industry lagging most Midwest markets in key occupancy and rate metrics. Average daily rates and occupancy had returned to pre-pandemic levels, but revenue per available room was not forecast to snap back until 2025.

TCB
: You mentioned Minneapolis outperformed projections to see a 9% boost in revenue per available room last year, obviously a good thing, cough, 
Taylor Swift
. Are there other signs of improvement in the local hotel market? Or are we still 25th of 25th in business metrics?
Ben Graves
: Can I explain what’s happening nationally, first, to better understand what’s happening locally?
TCB
: Sure.
 


 


BG
: If we look at hospitality since beginning of Covid, everyone was initially in a world of hurt. People had stopped traveling. Then the first thing to come back was leisure travel. People were working remotely, they were pent-up, they wanted to go on a vacation. Initially it was US travel. They were afraid to go abroad. U.S. leisure destinations rebounded quickly.
TCB
: I remember going to Phoenix in early fall ’21, usually a slow time, and paying spring break prices.

BG
: Yes. [Our company has] hotels in leisure destinations that had some of their best years in ’21. OK, the next to come back was groups and events. Everything from weddings to business meetings. All these companies hadn’t held corporate functions for two or three years. They had to get their people together. Convention hotels started bouncing back. Then some cities started to come back with leisure travel. Nashville for example. But Minneapolis didn’t have much [demand] for leisure travel.
And lastly was business travel, road warriors, consultants, sales. Those people are now starting to travel, but it isn’t as much as it used to be. Last year was the first-time business travel departments started to be willing to renegotiate corporate contracts because our costs are up so much.
 


 


Most recently [in ’23], smaller companies in smaller markets like La Crosse and Racine, Wisconsin, resumed traveling, companies like Trane. It’s the Fortune 500s that haven’t come back yet, and those are the companies that dominate Minneapolis. We thought this diversity of Fortune 500s would insulate us, but it’s those companies that have become most proficient at remote work and meeting. They’re still traveling less.
As a whole, the hospitality industry reached pre-pandemic levels in late ’22. 
But in Minneapolis we remain way behind
. Some of the bottom markets [nationally] are Minneapolis, Chicago, the [SFO] Bay Area, Portland [Oregon].
TCB
: How about downtown Minneapolis specifically?
BG
: Downtown hotels are surviving on sporting events, concerts, and entertainment. Our Moxy near US Bank Stadium is doing quite well. Our Residence Inn at 8th and LaSalle is doing OK with theatrical productions and their crews and performers, etc.
 


 


Downtown Minneapolis is a purpose-built place for large companies and commuters. Pre-2020, it was an office and entertainment environment. As of last November, 51.5% of commercial real estate in downtown was under water, not cash flowing for its debt. The closest city to that was Chicago at 19%. We’re 250% of any other city. That’s ominous. There are hotels for sale in downtown that are going to sell for pennies on the dollar. 
[Graves sold its Graves 601 Hotel to Loews in 2014 for $65 million, Loews invested an additional $18 million, and 
just sold the hotel for $23.5million
, roughly a 75% discount.]
So we have a lot of heavy lifting to do. There’s positives in [Minneapolis] being the [national] epicenter for change, there’s a lot of pride in the city, but it’s gonna take a lot of work to make the core of Minneapolis successful again.
TCB
: What thing would move the needle most?
BG
: It’d be trying to reinvent a single-purpose downtown core. Diversify the 9 to 5 downtown. Many downtowns have an office tower next to a condo tower next to an entertainment complex and we don’t have that.
 


 


TCB
: You’re not pinning a lot of hope on the corporate sector repopulating downtown.
BG
: I think that will slowly come back.
TCB
: It seems like a lot of hotels downscaled in the pandemic, service quality, amenities. They’re back to charging the same rates, but with a new diminished service model and they seem unapologetic about it. Are they trying to recoup losses?
 


 


BG
: It was a combination of controlling expenses to come back after the pandemic. Our business is so fractioned, Adam. We don’t have lobbyists in government like airlines do, [most owners] have a handful of hotels, maybe one or 10 or 20. To activate change for this industry is more difficult. The airlines have successfully gotten people to check in on a device, pay for their seat well in advance, and be content without receiving a refund if they cancel. I think those are the kind of things [our industry] struggles with.
TCB
: I heard someone suggest every hotel in downtown Minneapolis is losing six to seven figures annually.
BG: 
Well, we opened the Graves in 2004. In the Great Recession of 2008, downtown hotels couldn’t necessarily pay their loans, but they could cover operating costs. Since the pandemic there are markets where the EBITDA is not even cash positive. Hotels that came back quicker were the ones with lower operating costs and less [workers].
Hotels are also a real estate business. A lot of owners make money on [real estate] transactions. But we’re also operating overhead heavy. We’re capital expensive because we have a lot of employees. A full-service hotel might have one employee for every room, whereas a limited-service hotel might operate with 20 team members for 100 rooms.
Interest rates coming down would help a lot. [In hotels, mortgages] are not fixed like your house. You’re paying a variable interest rate. It’s up near 12% right now. It’s very difficult to make money.
TCB
: Have labor costs gone up as dramatically as in restaurants?
BG
: It’s gone up very dramatically. More so. It’s become harder to attract people. So you offer really great wages, really great benefits. You offer a great culture. Younger people want to be in an environment where they feel appreciated and have fun. That old top-down management school of fine hotels, that doesn’t cut it today.
TCB
: Who’s doing well in this market?
BG
: Since the pandemic, our InterContinental at the airport leads the market in [revenue per available room, a common industry metric].
TCB
: Leads the entire Twin Cities?
BG
: The Bloomington market is far and away the [healthiest] hotel market in the Twin Cities and we lead that market. Back when we started that hotel, we said we were going to try to compete with downtown Minneapolis, which led the market at the time. During the pandemic, that 100% flipped.
TCB
: Did the industry receive any specialized help from the government other than what every other business was offered, PPP etc.?
BG
: It’s crazy. Because of the factors I talked about, we didn’t get any of the restaurant or entertainment funding. We didn’t get the bailout the airlines got. It’s because we’re very fractioned, among other things.
TCB
: Five to 10 years from now what does this industry look like? Will this crisis of debt and pandemic legacy change it?
BG
: I still have high hopes for the industry. ‘Bleisure’ [travel] is a positive trend. [Combining work and vacation allows people to make longer stays and travel more often.] There will be more lifestyle hotels with good food and good cocktails. Some technology growth will change how you check in and interact with the hotel. The unique operators who are really good at delivering great service and guest experiences are going to win. Guests are looking for experiences. There will be commodity hotels, with a bed and a shower, and experience hotels. The hotels caught in the middle aren’t going to be as successful. That’s why people will pay more for our Moxy Hotel with a cool vibrant bar versus a hotel with the same amenities but no vibe, like a Fairfield Inn.
TCB
: So it’s still a business where innovation distinguishes itself, it’s not a full-on commodity business like airlines?
BG
: Exactly. And it’s still a business where everything in someone’s life can take place within the four walls of a hotel. That’s what makes it exciting, but also challenging.

Growing up as young Muslims in Minnesota, Rahma Musa and Abdi Isse
 
remember Ramadan going largely unnoticed outside of their homes and places of worship. They remember not being able to properly celebrate Eid El-Fitr, an annual celebration of breaking fast that commences immediately after the last night of Ramadan. 
Throughout the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, Muslims across the world observe Ramadan, a month of fasting, reflection, devotion, generosity and sacrifice. This year, Ramadan began March 10 and ends the evening of April 9. The day after Ramadan, Eid El-Fitr, is one of the two main holidays celebrated by Muslims.

However, growing up, “We didn’t have a holiday here. We had to go to school,” Issa said. His parents often weren’t able to get time off work to celebrate the day with prayer, feasting and the giving of Zakat al-Fitr (charity given to the poor to ensure all can celebrate the day). 
 


 


Born in Kenya, Musa remembers what it felt like to experience Ramadan and Eid outside of the U.S. 
“It’s a lot different. It’s like clockwork. Everybody is off work, off school. Everybody is celebrating with their loved ones,” she said. 
Musa and Issa reflected on these memories Wednesday, March 27, after watching the St. Paul City Council unanimously pass a resolution to recognize and commemorate the month of Ramadan and Eid Al-Fitr. 
Muslim community members spoke during and after the meeting about how this resolution shows their local leaders see them and embrace them as part of the St. Paul community. Issa and Mussa, now in their early 20s, said this show of support and recognition is especially impactful to young Muslims growing up in Minnesota. 
 


 


 


 


The resolution was not only passed unanimously by the historic all-woman city council, it was also sponsored by all seven members. This unanimous show of approval was also exhibited by the
 council recently in the passage of a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel
. 
Before the reading of the resolution, Abdisamad Loyan, community leader and member of Darul Uloom, praised the council for their joint efforts in drafting the resolution. As a Muslim entering professional life in the U.S. 40 years ago, Loyan knows what it feels like to be in rooms where people don’t recognize Ramadan and Muslim holidays. 
“We hid our faith. We did not pray in those cubicles. We waited until we got home to pray,” said Loyan. “That’s no longer the case thanks to the people like you who keep up the good work.”
Abdulahi Farah, director and lead organizer of the Muslim Coalition of ISAIAH, translated during the meeting. The resolution, most importantly, brings a sense of belonging to the community, he said afterward. 
 


 


“(The resolution is important) so that those who represent us know us,” Farah said. 
In 2020, Minneapolis made history in its recognition of Ramadan when the adhan – a call to prayer – 
was broadcast from the rooftop
 of Dar Al-Hijrah Mosque in Cedar-Riverside.

Earlier this month, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced the “Imagine Yourself” marketing campaign that will target preferred candidates for jobs within the police and 911 operating departments.

 City of Minneapolis
From hiring bonuses and other incentives to targeted recruitment campaigns, bolstering the ranks of police officers after massive decreases in recent years remains a priority for many departments. 
The Minneapolis Police Department, like departments nationwide, has been plagued by staffing woes since 2020, which saw the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the murder of George Floyd in May 2020 at the hands of then-MPD officer Derek Chauvin. To combat the issue, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey earlier this month announced a multi-year campaign aimed at recruiting and retaining more public safety staff. While the goal of the campaign is to hire more officers as a way to remedy staffing concerns, another solution may lie in using alternative non-police responses for lower priority calls for service.
Persistent staffing woes
As of March 9, MPD has 560 sworn officers, including 22 officers on continuous leave of two weeks or more, according to data obtained from the city.

A wave of retirements, resignations and disability leaves caused the number of sworn officers to continually decrease since Floyd’s murder and the ensuing unrest, steadily declining over the nearly four year period from a force of just over 900 officers in May 2020. Meanwhile, the portion of officers on leave simultaneously began to spike, peaking in December 2020 at 152 officers on leave out of 818, or about 19% of their sworn force, according to city data.
Persistent challenges to recruit new hires in recent years 
is a problem not just in Minneapolis, but in departments in the Twin Cities metro, statewide and across the country. MPD Chief Brian O’Hara, who spoke on a panel alongside Newark, New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka and several scholars highlighted those struggles. 
“When I say that the department is 40% smaller than it was at the start of 2020, that’s overall. Our investigations unit has shrunk by almost 50%,” O’Hara said during the panel, which was convened in November. “We might soon be in a situation where we’re just not going to investigate property crimes anymore. We might have to do that. And the community that will suffer the most is north Minneapolis.”
In a statement to MinnPost, Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association spokeswoman Leslie Rosedahl declined to comment on MPD and the city’s recruitment and retention efforts. But she said smaller departments across the state are struggling to recruit and retain officers due to more competitive pay at metro area departments. 
 


 


The statement also tied staffing efforts to waning support for law enforcement as a profession – an oft-cited reason in recent years for hiring troubles after the perception of policing changed for many members of the public following Floyd’s murder. 
“Having elected officials that support law enforcement and first responders also plays an outsized role in recruitment and retention,” she said. 
 


 


Attempts at fixes
Earlier this month, Frey announced the “Imagine Yourself” marketing campaign that will target preferred candidates for jobs within the police and 911 operating departments. The campaign was developed by the city and a contracted third-party firm in September in an effort to reach people ages 18 to 44 within a 300-mile radius of Minneapolis via social media ads, job boards, emails, billboards and flyers.
“We’re committed to trying every available option for recruiting and retention because ultimately that’s what this city needs,” Frey said during the news conference announcing the campaign. “This campaign is really about people’s lives, it’s about filling a very critical safety need in our city – part of that safety need is police officers and 911 dispatchers.”
 


 


The campaign comes almost two years after the mayor dedicated $7 million in American Rescue Plan dollars toward strategies for recruitment, hiring and retention. 
A day after the campaign was announced, the Minneapolis City Council approved a directive, authored by Ward 2 Council Member Robin Wonsley, that asks the mayor to provide an update on the implementation of recommendations from 
a 2022 report
 aimed at improving MPD and emergency services staffing issues. Among the recommendations provided by the report was for the city to look at implementing alternative responses to police for calls such as mental health crises as a way to efficiently free up officers for patrols or higher priority calls. 
Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, echoed the report’s recommendation, saying while programs like the 
Behavioral Crisis Response teams
 now exist, the city can do more. Gross said by bolstering the use of alternative responses and diverting certain calls away from police officers, the city could potentially solve its staffing issues and further implement its long-stated goal of public safety beyond policing.
“Part of public safety is doing things like addressing community conflicts, mental health issues and public health issues like substance use disorder,” Gross said. “These things can be handled by non-law enforcement folks, and in fact, there are better outcomes when they are handled by those folks.”

The family of Ricky Cobb II, the 33-year-old Black man fatally shot by a Minnesota state trooper during a traffic stop last year, spoke out on Monday against calls from elected officials and police unions to take the case from Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty.
In a statement from the attorneys representing Cobb’s family, they accused officials of politicizing the case to influence an active prosecution. The family asked Gov. Tim Walz not to reassign the case and to allow Moriarty to prosecute the case like any other murder. 
“Reassigning this case would create a clear conflict of interests and removing it from the County Attorney should not be an option,” said the attorneys representing the family in a statement. “Mr. Cobb’s family has suffered enough. They don’t deserve this too.”
 


 


The charges came months after a lengthy investigation into the killing, which occurred in July on Interstate 94 when three troopers tried to pull Cobb II out of his vehicle. Cobb II appeared to attempt to pull off when trooper Ryan Londregan shot into the moving vehicle. Moriarty’s office charged Londregan with second degree unintentional murder, second degree manslaughter and first degree assault in January. 
Earlier this month, court filings from Londregan’s defense claimed that Moriarty had hired a use of force expert to help the office determine whether to bring charges against the trooper. According to the filing, Jeffrey Noble, a national use of force expert, said during a meeting with the prosecution that Londregan had acted lawfully to save his partner.

The filings claim Moriarty’s office lied by omission by not divulging the expert’s finding and bringing charges anyway three months after the meeting with Noble that had occurred in October. That prompted groups like the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association (MPPOA) to accuse Moriarty – who ran and won her seat on a platform partly based on police accountability – of “lying by omission” and enacting an anti-police agenda. 
“This is what happens in a political prosecution. Trooper Ryan is a hero who saved his partner’s life,” MPPOA executive director Brian Peters said in a statement. “Anyone who cares about the rule of law needs to care about this case – it’s an unjust prosecution.”
 


 


That was quickly followed by calls from Minnesota House Republicans in the state Legislature for Moriarty to resign and drop the charges against Londregan. 
In response, Hennepin County Attorney’s Office spokesman Nick Kimball released a statement calling the claims that the use of force expert had come to any conclusions on Londregan’s conduct were false. Kimball said the expert had come in for a preliminary meeting to help the prosecution determine where there may be gaps in the office’s investigation, and that the hypotheticals discussed in that meeting were taken out of context by the defense. 
 


 


The full discussion in that meeting was provided in discovery to the defense, who then selectively quoted from the document despite the expert acknowledging he did not have significant information related to the prosecution’s investigation nor did he know how to interpret the use of force legal standard in Minnesota, Kimball said in the statement. 
“Once again the defense is abusing the legal process to initiate inaccurate pretrial publicity in this case,” the statement reads. 
 


 


In the past week, the four Republican members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation – U.S. Reps. Michelle Fischbach, Tom Emmer, Brad Finstad and Pete Stauber – wrote a letter to Walz asking that he take the case from Moriarty’s office, and suggesting that an investigation into the matter could be conducted by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee. The letter goes on to claim the charges brought by Moriarty’s office are political in nature and further illustrates the “denigration” of law enforcement as a profession.
“The split second that officers have to make life-and-death decisions has often been clouded by the fear of political persecution, like what is happening to Trooper Londregan right now,” the letter reads. “Enough is enough. The uncertainty that this frivolous case puts in officers’ minds could cost them their lives.”
Reps. Angie Craig and Dean Phillips, both Democrats, also came out in favor of having the case taken away from Moriarty’s office.

Walz has mused publicly about whether to reassign the case from Moriarty’s office, which he has the legal authority to do and has done once before last year with the high-profile murder case of 
Zaria McKeever
. 
University of St. Thomas School of Law Professor Rachel Moran, who founded the school’s Criminal and Juvenile Defense Clinic, said having the governor speculate about local prosecutors’ decisions adds an additional unfair pressure to a case that already has high stakes. Should Walz reassign the case it would be a very anti-democratic decision, she said. 
“The people of Hennepin County elected Mary Moriarty. Some of the things she is doing are the things that she said she would do – it’s not as if she’s pulling a bait and switch on the voters,” Moran said. “It’s really problematic when the governor overrules the decision of the local voters and says, ‘I’m essentially not trusting your judgment on this.’”

Josh Wilson, 57, hasn’t committed a crime in almost 17 years but the felony convictions on his record have hindered his search for work. 
“First, I tried to drive for Metro Transit. I got denied because of my criminal history,” he said. “I can’t even do DoorDash, I can’t even do Uber because of my criminal history and this (conviction) is 16 years old.”
Wilson is now employed by the Minneapolis Public Works Department and is hoping to get a management-level position.
 


 


“If I could get a management position, I’d be really close to six figures a year,” he said.

To make that a reality, Wilson, along with dozens of others, attended an expungement clinic held by the Hennepin County Attorney’s office on Wednesday, where adults with felony convictions from the office can start an expedited process to get the convictions off their records. The clinic, in partnership with Urban League Twin Cities and the Minnesota Justice Research Center, among others, aimed to help people get a fresh start to remove barriers and rebuild their lives.
“Seeing the number of people that are here and hearing about the number of people that have been here all day is wonderful in a sense, but also, it is bittersweet,” said Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty. “People have been convicted of felonies and even after they’ve done whatever it is that they needed to do, they can’t move forward with their lives, and so we can see the tremendous need for expungement.”
Other attendees included Tyrone Henry, 56, who’s hoping to go back to college after getting two felonies off his record, which are preventing him from accessing financial aid. Eventually, he wants to get a loan to start his own small business. 
 


 


“I’ve got a job but I’m just trying to better my life,” Henry said. “I’m trying to start any kind of Black-owned business – I build houses, I can (do) landscaping and construction.”
 


 


Moriarty said her office came up with the idea as a way to make the process of expungement more accessible. Her office has one attorney that does expungements and the online version of the process was already available, but due to reasons like being English as a second language or lack of access to a computer, they decided to bring the process into the community.
In addition to helping improve the lives of residents by removing barriers to success, Moriarty said she sees expungement as a way to improve public safety as well. 
“If somebody has a felony conviction and they cannot get a job, they can’t find a house they can afford, it could be a huge problem and they could go out and do things that we don’t want them to do,” she said. “So giving them that opportunity to move forward is really critical to public safety.”
 


 


Several other organizations like the League of Women Voters and MAD DADS were at the event to provide resources like helping people register to vote, do their taxes and find jobs. 
“Being in the community more often will bring more awareness to the fact that we are able to help people and hopefully some of their issues can be resolved,” said Natasha Rice, a community representative from Rep. Ilhan Omar’s (MN-5th) office, who was at the event to provide assistance to attendees who may be having issues related to federal agencies, like housing or immigration.
Moriarty said her office plans to hold several more community expungement clinics going forward.
