# Twin Cities News Comparison

**A Digital Content Analysis of Nonprofit News Coverage in the Twin Cities**

This repository contains the tools, data, and documentation for a comparative content analysis project examining the editorial practices and narrative strategies of two influential nonprofit newsrooms in the Twin Cities region: *MinnPost* and *Sahan Journal*. The project investigates how these newsrooms frame and report on three structurally embedded civic issues—public safety and policing, educational inequities, and environmental justice—with an eye toward understanding how nonprofit journalism engages local publics, represents marginalized communities, and navigates institutional and civic obligations.

## 🧠 Project Rationale

In the contemporary media environment, nonprofit news organizations have emerged as vital institutions for local accountability, particularly in under-served and structurally excluded communities. Yet little empirical work has examined how these outlets construct the "local public" through coverage, whose voices are elevated or excluded, and what ideological or narrative frameworks guide their reporting.

This project aims to bridge that gap by combining **digital methods**, **qualitative coding**, and **comparative analysis** to examine:
- **Media framing of structural issues**
- **Audience positioning and community engagement**
- **Source diversity and representation**
- **Editorial decisions within nonprofit constraints**

## 📰 Newsrooms Under Study

- **MinnPost**: A nonprofit newsroom founded in 2007, known for in-depth reporting on Minnesota politics, policy, and civic life.
- **Sahan Journal**: Established in 2019, this newsroom focuses on immigrant and communities of color, centering racial equity and lived experience in local reporting.

## 📚 Research Questions

1. How do MinnPost and Sahan Journal frame public safety, education, and environmental justice issues in their reporting?
2. What types of sources are most frequently quoted or cited across these topics?
3. How do these newsrooms differ in their editorial orientation and imagined audiences?
4. In what ways do nonprofit missions shape narrative strategies and the construction of civic identity?

## 🧰 Methodology

### 1. Semi-Structured Interviews
- Interviews with 4–6 newsroom personnel at each outlet (editors, reporters, audience leads).
- Focused on editorial priorities, community outreach, and institutional challenges.
- Transcribed and thematically coded in NVivo or Dedoose.

### 2. Comparative Content Analysis
- A purposive sample of 20–30 articles per outlet (~60 total).
- Topics include:
  - Public safety and policing (e.g., “police reform,” “MPD,” “public safety charter”)
  - Education inequities (e.g., “achievement gap,” “Minneapolis Public Schools,” “teacher strike”)
  - Environmental justice/urban redevelopment (e.g., “Highway 252,” “pollution,” “North Minneapolis redevelopment”)
- Both news reporting and opinion pieces are included.
- Coded for:
  - Framing (structural, institutional, individual)
  - Source types (government, community, experts, activists)
  - Language and tone (emotive, neutral, advocacy-oriented)
  - Audience positioning and civic engagement cues
  - Visual representation (photos, captions, imagery)
    
  - ### 3. Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for article scraping using [`newspaper3k`](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- **Pandas** for data wrangling and preprocessing
- **NVivo/Dedoose** for qualitative analysis and thematic coding
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploratory data analysis and visualization
